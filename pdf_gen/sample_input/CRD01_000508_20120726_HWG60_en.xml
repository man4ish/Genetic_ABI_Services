        <Title>Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</Title>
        <Text>Abdominal aortic aneurysm represents the most common form of aortic aneurysm. An aneurysm is a localised ballooning (dilation) of a blood vessel, and can occur throughout the body. Risk factors include gender, smoking, age (&amp;gt; 65 years), atherosclerosis, and family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aneurysms often have few symptoms but they may cause pain in the abdomen or back as a result of the pressure they exert. An aneurysm may rupture at any time, which can lead to a major internal blood spill, and to sudden death. The repair of any rupture is very dangerous and is associated with a high mortality rate. For larger aneurysms the risk associated with surgical repair is significantly less than the risk of rupture, so medical intervention can be applied. It is therefore invaluable to know whether you are at increased risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Ultrasound-based testing can then be considered for confirmation.</Text>

            <Caption>An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when a lower portion of your body's main artery (aorta) becomes weakened and bulges.</Caption>
          </Image>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a weakened and bulging area in the lower part of the aorta, the major blood vessel that supplies blood to the body. The aorta, about the thickness of a garden hose, runs from your heart through the center of your chest and abdomen. Because the aorta is the body's main supplier of blood, a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause life-threatening bleeding. Although you may never have symptoms, finding out you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be frightening. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most small and slow-growing abdominal aortic aneurysms don't rupture, but large, fast-growing abdominal aortic aneurysms may. Depending on the size and rate at which the aortic aneurysm is growing, treatment may vary from watchful waiting to emergency surgery. Once an abdominal aortic aneurysm is found, doctors will closely monitor it so that surgery can be planned if it's necessary. Emergency surgery for a ruptured abdominal aneurysm can be risky. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Definition>
        <Causes Image="0">
          <Title>Causes</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Most aortic aneurysms occur in the part of your aorta that's in your abdomen. Although the exact cause of abdominal aortic aneurysms is unknown, a number of factors may play a role, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tobacco use.&lt;/strong&gt; Cigarette smoking and other forms of tobacco use appear to increase your risk of aortic aneurysms. In addition to the damaging effects that smoking causes directly to the arteries, smoking contributes to the buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure. Smoking can also cause your aneurysm to grow faster by further damaging your aorta.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; High blood pressure, especially if poorly controlled, increases the risk of developing an aortic aneurysm. This is because high blood pressure can damage and weaken your arteries.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infection in the aorta (vasculitis).&lt;/strong&gt; In rare cases, aortic aneurysm may be caused by an infection or inflammation that weakens a section of the aortic wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aneurysms can develop anywhere along the aorta, but when they occur in the upper part of the aorta, they are called thoracic aortic aneurysms. More commonly, aneurysms form in the lower part of your aorta, and are called abdominal aortic aneurysms. Rarely, an aneurysm can occur in between the upper and lower parts of your aorta. This type of aneurysm is called a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly and usually without symptoms, making them difficult to detect. Some aneurysms will never rupture. Many start small and stay small, although many expand over time. Some aortic aneurysms enlarge slowly, increasing less than half an inch (1.2 centimeters) a year. Others expand at a faster rate, which increases the risk of rupture. How quickly an aortic aneurysm may enlarge is difficult to predict. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an aortic aneurysm enlarges, some people may notice: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A pulsating feeling near the navel&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tenderness or pain in the abdomen or chest&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Back pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You should see your doctor if you have any of the symptoms listed above. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyone age 60 and older who has risk factors for developing an aortic aneurysm should consider regular screening for the condition. Men ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked cigarettes should have a one-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm using abdominal ultrasound. Men age 60 and older with a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm should also consider screening. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have a family history of aortic aneurysm, your doctor may recommend regular ultrasound exams to screen for the condition.

          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age.&lt;/strong&gt; Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 60 and older.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tobacco use.&lt;/strong&gt; Tobacco use is a strong risk factor for the development of an aortic aneurysm. The longer you've smoked or chewed tobacco, the greater your risk.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; Increased blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the body, raising your chances of developing an aneurysm.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atherosclerosis.&lt;/strong&gt; Atherosclerosis, the buildup of fat and other substances that can damage the lining of a blood vessel, increases your risk of an aneurysm.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being male.&lt;/strong&gt; Men develop aortic aneurysms much more often than women do. However, women with aortic aneurysms have a higher risk of rupture than do men.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race.&lt;/strong&gt; Aortic aneurysms occur more commonly in whites than in people of other races.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history.&lt;/strong&gt; People who have a family history of aortic aneurysm are at increased risk of having one. People who have a family history of aneurysms tend to develop aneurysms at a younger age and are at higher risk of rupture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>

            <Caption>When an aneurysm ruptures (dissects), blood begins to leak out of the affected artery. A dissected aneurysm is a medical emergency.</Caption>
          </Image>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Tears in the wall of the aorta (dissection) and rupture of the aneurysm are the main complications of abdominal aortic aneurysm. A ruptured aortic aneurysm can lead to life-threatening internal bleeding. In general, the larger the aneurysm, the greater the risk of rupture. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Signs and symptoms that your aortic aneurysm has burst include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sudden, intense and persistent abdominal, chest or back pain&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pain that radiates to your back or legs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sweatiness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Clamminess&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dizziness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Low blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fast pulse&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Loss of consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another complication of aortic aneurysms is the risk of blood clots. Small blood clots can develop in the area of the aortic aneurysm. If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall of an aneurysm and blocks a blood vessel elsewhere in your body, it can cause pain or block the blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or abdominal organs. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Complications>
        <Lifestyle Image="0">
          <Title>Lifestyle and home remedies</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Statin medications and some antibiotics may slow the growth of small aortic aneurysms. There's also some evidence that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan (Cozaar) may prevent aneurysm formation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The best approach to prevent an aortic aneurysm is to keep your blood vessels as healthy as possible. That means taking these steps: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quit smoking or chewing tobacco.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep your blood pressure under control.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get regular exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reduce cholesterol and fat in your diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have some risk factors for aortic aneurysm, talk to your doctor. If you are at risk, your doctor may recommend additional measures, including medications to lower your blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries. You may also want to consider screening ultrasounds every few years.

      <Description>
        <Title>Atrial Fibrillation</Title>
        <Text>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a term used for an irregular heart rhythm (heartbeat). The condition is characterised by rapid and uncoordinated contractions of the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) which are not synchronised with the ventricles (lower chambers of the heart). When this occurs, the blood flow between the atria and the ventricles is disrupted, causing retention of blood in the heart and decreased blood flow to the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many cases AF is asymptomatic but may also be associated with symptoms such as palpitations, tachycardia, cyanosis and congestive heart failure. As many as one third of stroke cases are caused by AF. Other indications of AF could include chest pain, respiratory distress, hypoxia that in turn may lead to pneumonia, and sleep apnoea. AF may be caused by hypertension, pulmonary embolism, alcohol consumption and genetic risk factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This disease is associated with a reduced quality of life. Warfarin may be prescribed to protect affected individuals from stroke . Please be aware of the genetic differences associated with warfarin sensitivity. This can be found in the latter section of this report.</Text>

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that commonly causes poor blood flow to the body. During atrial fibrillation, the heart's two upper chambers (the atria) beat chaotically and irregularly &amp;mdash; out of coordination with the two lower chambers (the ventricles) of the heart. Atrial fibrillation symptoms include heart palpitations, shortness of breath and weakness. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Episodes of atrial fibrillation can come and go, or you may have chronic atrial fibrillation. Although atrial fibrillation itself usually isn't life-threatening, it is a serious medical condition that sometimes requires emergency treatment. It can lead to complications. Treatments for atrial fibrillation may include medications and other interventions to try to alter the heart's electrical system. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Caption>A normal heartbeat begins when a tiny cluster of cells called the sinus node sends an electrical signal (1). The signal then travels through the atria and passes through another group of cells called the atrioventricular node (2). From the atrioventricular node, the signal travels through the ventricles (3), causing them to contract and pump out blood. After this, the process starts over (4).</Caption>
          </Image>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Your heart consists of four chambers &amp;mdash; two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Within the upper right chamber of your heart (right atrium) is a group of cells called the sinus node. This is your heart's natural pacemaker. The sinus node produces the impulse that starts each heartbeat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Normally, the impulse travels first through the atria and then through a connecting pathway between the upper and lower chambers of your heart called the atrioventricular (AV) node. As the signal passes through the atria, they contract, pumping blood from your atria into the ventricles below. As the signal passes through the AV node to the ventricles, the ventricles contract, pumping blood out to your body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In atrial fibrillation, the upper chambers of your heart (atria) experience chaotic electrical signals. As a result, they quiver. The AV node &amp;mdash; the electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles &amp;mdash; is overloaded with impulses trying to get through to the ventricles. The ventricles also beat rapidly, but not as rapidly as the atria. The reason is that the AV node is like a highway on-ramp &amp;mdash; only so many cars can get on at one time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The result is a fast and irregular heart rhythm. The heart rate in atrial fibrillation may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute. The normal range for a heart rate is 60 to 100 beats a minute. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Possible causes of atrial fibrillation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Abnormalities or damage to the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation. Possible causes of atrial fibrillation include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heart attacks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Abnormal heart valves&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heart defects you're born with (congenital)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;An overactive thyroid gland or other metabolic imbalance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Exposure to stimulants such as medications, caffeine or tobacco, or to alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sick sinus syndrome &amp;mdash; improper functioning of the heart's natural pacemaker&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Emphysema or other lung diseases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Previous heart surgery&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Viral infections&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stress due to pneumonia, surgery or other illnesses&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sleep apnea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, some people who have atrial fibrillation don't have any heart defects or damage, a condition called lone atrial fibrillation. In lone atrial fibrillation, the cause is often unclear, and serious complications are rare. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Atrial flutter&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, but the rhythm in your atria is more organized and less chaotic than the abnormal patterns common with atrial fibrillation. Sometimes you may have atrial flutter that develops into atrial fibrillation and vice versa. The symptoms, causes and risk factors of atrial flutter are similar to those of atrial fibrillation. For example, strokes are a concern in someone with atrial flutter. As with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter is usually not life-threatening when it's properly treated. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
A heart in atrial fibrillation doesn't beat efficiently. It may not be able to pump enough blood out to your body with each heartbeat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms and are unaware of their condition until it's discovered during a physical examination. Those who do have atrial fibrillation symptoms may experience: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Palpitations, which are sensations of a racing, uncomfortable, irregular heartbeat or a flopping in your chest&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Decreased blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Weakness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lightheadedness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Confusion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Atrial fibrillation may be: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occasional.&lt;/strong&gt; In this case it's called paroxysmal (par-ok-SIZ-mul) atrial fibrillation. You may have symptoms that come and go, lasting for a few minutes to hours and then stopping on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic.&lt;/strong&gt; With chronic atrial fibrillation, your heart rhythm is always abnormal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have any symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor should be able to tell you if your symptoms are caused by atrial fibrillation or another heart arrhythmia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have chest pain, seek emergency medical assistance immediately. Chest pain could signal that you're having a heart attack. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Symptoms>
        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age.&lt;/strong&gt; The older you are, the greater your risk of developing atrial fibrillation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart disease.&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone with heart disease, including valve problems and a history of heart attack and heart surgery, has an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; Having high blood pressure, especially if it's not well controlled with lifestyle changes or medications, can increase your risk of atrial fibrillation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other chronic conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; People with thyroid problems, sleep apnea and other medical problems have an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt; For some people, drinking alcohol can trigger an episode of atrial fibrillation. Binge drinking &amp;mdash; having five drinks in two hours for men, or four drinks for women &amp;mdash; may put you at higher risk.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history.&lt;/strong&gt; An increased risk of atrial fibrillation runs in some families.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Risk>
        <Complications Image="0">
          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes atrial fibrillation can lead to the following complications: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Stroke.&lt;/strong&gt; In atrial fibrillation, the chaotic rhythm may cause blood to pool in your heart's upper chambers (atria) and form clots. If a blood clot forms, it could dislodge from your heart and travel to your brain. There it might block blood flow, causing a stroke.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
	The risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation depends on your age (you have a higher risk as you age) and on whether you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of heart failure or previous stroke, and other factors. Medications such as blood thinners can greatly lower your risk of stroke or damage to other organs caused by blood clots. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart failure.&lt;/strong&gt; Atrial fibrillation, especially if not controlled, may weaken the heart, leading to heart failure &amp;mdash; a condition in which your heart can't circulate enough blood to meet your body's needs.&lt;/li&gt;

You may need to make lifestyle changes that improve the overall health of your heart, especially to prevent or treat conditions such as high blood pressure. Your doctor may suggest that you: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eat heart-healthy foods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use less salt, which can help lower blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increase your physical activity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quit smoking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoid drinking more than one drink of alcohol for women or more than two drinks for men a day&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>Brain Aneurysm</Title>
        <Text>A brain aneurysm is a cerebrovascular condition caused by the localised ballooning or dilation of an artery in the brain. Small aneurysms may display no obvious signs (asymptomatic) but larger aneurysms may be associated with sudden severe headaches, vision impairment or even loss of consciousness. A ruptured brain aneurysm leads to bleeding in the brain, or subarachnoid haemorrhage. This may cause severe brain damage or death resulting from a haemorrhagic stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brain aneurysms can occur in adults and children but are most common in adult women. The risk for brain aneurysm is greatly increased by high blood pressure and atherosclerosis. There are surgical approaches to treating ruptured brain aneurysms but these procedures usually result in permanent disability or death.</Text>

            <Caption>An aneurysm is a ballooning at a weak spot in an artery wall. An aneurysm's walls can be thin enough to rupture. The illustration shows a woman with an unruptured aneurysm. The inset shows the aneurysm before and after rupture.</Caption>

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
A brain aneurysm (AN-u-rizm) is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain. It often looks like a berry hanging on a stem. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A brain aneurysm can leak or rupture, causing bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). Most often a ruptured brain aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A ruptured aneurysm quickly becomes life-threatening and requires prompt medical treatment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most brain aneurysms, however, don't rupture, create health problems or cause symptoms. Such aneurysms are often detected during tests for other conditions. Treatment for an unruptured brain aneurysm may be appropriate in some cases and may prevent a rupture in the future. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Definition>
        <Causes Image="0">
          <Title>Causes</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Brain aneurysms develop as a result of thinning and degenerating artery walls. Aneurysms often form at forks or branches in arteries because those sections of the vessel are weaker. Although aneurysms can appear anywhere in the brain, they are most common in arteries at the base of the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ruptured aneurysm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;A sudden, severe headache is the key symptom of a ruptured aneurysm. This headache is often described as the "worst headache" ever experienced. Common signs and symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sudden, extremely severe headache&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nausea and vomiting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stiff neck&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Blurred or double vision&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sensitivity to light&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Seizure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A drooping eyelid&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Loss of consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Confusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;'Leaking' aneurysm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;In some cases, an aneurysm may leak a slight amount of blood. This leaking (sentinel bleed) may cause only a: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sudden, extremely severe headache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A more severe rupture almost always follows leaking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Unruptured aneurysm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;An unruptured brain aneurysm may produce no symptoms, particularly if it's small. However, a large unruptured aneurysm may press on brain tissues and nerves, possibly causing:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pain above and behind an eye&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A dilated pupil&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change in vision or double vision&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Numbness, weakness or paralysis of one side of the face&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A drooping eyelid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency. In about 30 percent of cases, ruptured brain aneurysms are fatal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Seek immediate medical attention&lt;/strong&gt; if you develop a: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sudden, extremely severe headache &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you're with someone who complains of a sudden, severe headache or who loses consciousness or has a seizure, call 911 or your local emergency number.
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
A number of factors can contribute to weakness in an artery wall and increase the risk of a brain aneurysm. Brain aneurysms are more common in adults than in children and more common in women than in men. Some of these risk factors develop over time; others are present at birth. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Risk factors that develop over time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;These include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Older age&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Smoking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure (hypertension)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Drug abuse, particularly the use of cocaine&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Head injury&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heavy alcohol consumption&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Certain blood infections&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lower estrogen levels after menopause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Risk factors present at birth&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;These include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inherited connective tissue disorders,&lt;/strong&gt; such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, that weaken blood vessels&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polycystic kidney disease,&lt;/strong&gt; an inherited disorder that results in fluid-filled sacs in the kidneys and usually increases blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abnormally narrow aorta&lt;/strong&gt; (coarctation of the aorta), the large blood vessel that delivers oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cerebral arteriovenous malformation&lt;/strong&gt; (brain AVM), an abnormal connection between arteries and veins in the brain that interrupts the normal flow of blood between them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history of brain aneurysm,&lt;/strong&gt; particularly a first-degree relative, such as a parent,  brother or sister&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Risk>
        <Complications Image="0">
          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
When a brain aneurysm ruptures, the bleeding usually lasts only a few seconds. The blood can cause direct damage to surrounding cells, and the bleeding can damage or kill other cells. It also increases pressure inside the skull. If the pressure becomes too elevated, the blood and oxygen supply to the brain may be disrupted to the point that loss of consciousness or even death may occur. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Complications that can develop after the rupture of an aneurysm include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-bleeding.&lt;/strong&gt; An aneurysm that has ruptured or leaked is at risk of bleeding again. Re-bleeding can cause further damage to brain cells.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vasospasm.&lt;/strong&gt; After a brain aneurysm ruptures, blood vessels in your brain may narrow erratically (vasospasm). This condition can limit blood flow to brain cells (ischemic stroke) and cause additional cell damage and loss.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrocephalus.&lt;/strong&gt; When an aneurysm rupture results in bleeding in the space between the brain and surrounding tissue (subarachnoid hemorrhage) &amp;mdash; most often the case &amp;mdash; the blood can block circulation of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). This condition can result in hydrocephalus, an excess of cerebrospinal fluid that increases pressure on the brain and can damage tissues.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyponatremia.&lt;/strong&gt; Subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured brain aneurysm can disrupt the balance of sodium in the blood supply. This may occur from damage to the hypothalamus, an area near the base of the brain. A drop in blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) can lead to swelling of brain cells and permanent damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>

        <Lifestyle Image="0">
          <Title>Lifestyle and home remedies</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
If you have an unruptured brain aneurysm, you may lower the risk of its rupture by making these lifestyle changes: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't smoke or use recreational drugs.&lt;/strong&gt; If you smoke or use recreational drugs, talk to your doctor about strategies or an appropriate treatment program to help you quit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a healthy diet and exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; Changes in diet and exercise can help lower blood pressure. Talk to your doctor about changes appropriate for you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit caffeine.&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine is a stimulant that can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid straining.&lt;/strong&gt; Sudden, forceful and sustained exertion of the type you expend when you lift heavy weights can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be cautious of aspirin use.&lt;/strong&gt; Talk to your doctor before taking aspirin or other drugs that inhibit blood clotting, because they may increase blood loss if you do have a ruptured aneurysm.&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</Title>
        <Text>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a group of medical conditions that cause the narrowing of breathing passages and the destruction of alveoli. Alveoli are situated at the end of the passages, and are responsible for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. There are two forms of the diseases-chronic bronchitis and emphysema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COPD is one of the most common pulmonary diseases and is strongly linked to smoking and air pollution. It develops over the years, but can be easily reversed if smoking is stopped early. Individuals with this disease have difficulties in breathing, especially when they exhale air from the lungs. COPD is caused by external factors that damage the walls of the breathing passages and the surface of the lungs. This damage makes the lungs less effective in exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen in the blood. Smoking is the leading cause of the disease, but other air pollutants also play an important role, including industrial gases and fumes, car exhaust fumes and smog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a smoker or are routinely exposed to occupational smoke or gasses and you have a chronic cough, sputum, wheezing or shortness of breath, you may have this disease. COPD may lead to respiratory failure and pulmonary heart disease.</Text>

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a group of lung diseases that block airflow as you exhale and make it increasingly difficult for you to breathe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Emphysema and chronic asthmatic bronchitis are the two main conditions that make up COPD. In all cases, damage to your airways eventually interferes with the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your lungs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
COPD is a leading cause of death and illness worldwide. Most COPD is caused by long-term smoking and can be prevented by not smoking or quitting soon after you start. This damage to your lungs can't be reversed, so treatment focuses on controlling symptoms and minimizing further damage. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Caption>In emphysema, inflammation damages the fibers around the walls of the alveoli, causing them to lose their natural elasticity and eventually to rupture. This creates one large air space instead of many small ones and reduces the surface area available for gas exchange.</Caption>
          </Image>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
COPD primarily refers to obstruction in the lungs caused by chronic asthmatic bronchitis and emphysema. Many people with COPD have both. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Chronic asthmatic bronchitis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Chronic asthmatic bronchitis causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways that lead into your lungs. This may cause you to cough and wheeze. Chronic asthmatic bronchitis also increases mucus production, which can further block the narrowed tubes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Emphysema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Emphysema damages the tiny air sacs in your lungs (alveoli) in two main ways. Alveoli are clustered like grapes and emphysema gradually destroys the inner walls of these clusters, reducing the amount of surface area available to exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide. In addition, emphysema also makes the alveoli walls weaker and less elastic, so they collapse with exhalation &amp;mdash; trapping air in the alveoli. Shortness of breath occurs because the chest wall muscles have to work harder to expel the air. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cigarette smoke and other irritants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
COPD is typically caused by long-term exposure to airborne irritants, such as: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tobacco smoke&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dust&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chemical fumes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Air pollution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
In general, symptoms of COPD don't appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time. People with COPD are also likely to experience episodes called exacerbations when their symptoms suddenly get much worse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Signs and symptoms of COPD can vary, depending on which lung disease is most prominent. Most people have more than one of these signs and symptoms at the same time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wheezing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chest tightness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chronic cough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Symptoms>
        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Risk factors for COPD include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposure to tobacco smoke.&lt;/strong&gt; The most significant risk factor for COPD is long-term cigarette smoking. The more years you smoke and the more packs you smoke, the greater your risk. Pipe smokers, cigar smokers and people exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke also are at risk. Chronic inhalation of marijuana smoke also can be injurious.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational exposure to dusts and chemicals.&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts can irritate and inflame your lungs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age.&lt;/strong&gt; COPD develops slowly over years, so most people are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetics.&lt;/strong&gt; A rare genetic disorder known as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the source of a few cases of COPD. Researchers suspect that other genetic factors may also make certain smokers more susceptible to the disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Risk>
        <Complications Image="0">
          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Complications of COPD include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respiratory infections.&lt;/strong&gt; When you have COPD, you're more likely to get frequent colds, the flu or pneumonia. Plus, any respiratory infection can make it much more difficult to breathe and produce further irreversible damage to the lung tissue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension). This puts great strain on the right ventricle of your heart and may cause your ankles and legs to swell.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart problems.&lt;/strong&gt; COPD also increases your risk of heart disease, including heart attack. This is in addition to the adverse effects of nicotine on the coronary arteries. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression.&lt;/strong&gt; Difficulty breathing can keep you from doing activities that you enjoy. And it can be very difficult to deal with a disease that is progressive and incurable. Talk to your doctor if you feel sad, helpless or depressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Complications>
        <Lifestyle Image="0">
          <Title>Lifestyle and home remedies</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
If you have COPD, you can take steps to feel better and slow the damage to your lungs:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control your breathing.&lt;/strong&gt; Talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions and relaxation techniques that you can use when you're short of breath.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear your airways.&lt;/strong&gt; In COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat healthy foods.&lt;/strong&gt; A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you're underweight, your doctor may recommend nutritional supplements. If you're overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid smoke.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to quitting smoking, it's important to avoid places where others smoke. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get vaccinated.&lt;/strong&gt; Respiratory infections can worsen your COPD symptoms. The annual flu shot helps reduce your chances of catching respiratory flu. The pneumonia vaccine lowers your risk of developing pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid crowds and cold air.&lt;/strong&gt; If you must go out into a crowd, use a surgical mask to help prevent germs from reaching your lungs. Cold air can trigger bronchospasm and shortness of breath. Put on a cold-air face mask before you go outdoors.&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>Coronary Heart Disease</Title>
        <Text>Coronary heart disease is caused by the narrowing of the coronary arteries due to atherosclerotic plaques (deposits of cholesterol and fat that occlude blood flow). The narrowing of the critical arteries restricts blood flow to the heart muscles, causing chest pains in the form of angina. This can lead to a heart attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coronary heart disease is caused by a number of risk factors that include smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, excessive consumption of alcohol, stress and hyperlipidemia. Coronary heart disease can be managed by consuming plenty of vegetables, maintaining an ideal weight and quitting smoking. Avoiding intake of trans fats and exercising regularly are also good preventive steps. Statins may be prescribed to manage LDL cholesterol levels along with beta-blockers for hypertension and arrhythmia. Aspirin may be prescribed to prevent excessive clotting in individuals at high risk for stroke and infarction.</Text>

Coronary artery disease develops when your coronary arteries &amp;mdash; the major blood vessels that supply your heart with blood, oxygen and nutrients &amp;mdash; become damaged or diseased. Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) on your arteries are usually to blame for coronary artery disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When plaques build up, they narrow your coronary arteries, causing your heart to receive less blood. Eventually, the decreased blood flow may cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because coronary artery disease often develops over decades, it can go virtually unnoticed until you have a heart attack. But there's plenty you can do to prevent and treat coronary artery disease. Start by committing to a healthy lifestyle. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Caption>Atherosclerosis is a process in which blood, fats such as cholesterol, and other substances build up on your artery walls. Eventually, deposits called plaques may form. The deposits may narrow &amp;mdash; or block &amp;mdash; your arteries. These plaques can also rupture, causing a blood clot.</Caption>
          </Image>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Coronary artery disease is thought to begin with damage or injury to the inner layer of a coronary artery, sometimes as early as childhood. The damage may be caused by various factors, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Smoking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Radiation therapy to the chest, as used for certain types of cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once the inner wall of an artery is damaged, fatty deposits (plaques) made of cholesterol and other cellular waste products tend to accumulate at the site of injury in a process called atherosclerosis. If the surface of these plaques breaks or ruptures, blood cells called platelets will clump at the site to try to repair the artery. This clump can block the artery, leading to a heart attack. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
If your coronary arteries become narrowed, they can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to your heart &amp;mdash; especially when it's beating hard, such as during exercise. At first, the decreased blood flow may not cause any coronary artery disease symptoms. As the plaques continue to build up in your coronary arteries, however, you may develop coronary artery disease symptoms, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest pain (angina).&lt;/strong&gt; You may feel pressure or tightness in your chest, as if someone were standing on your chest. The pain, referred to as angina, is usually triggered by physical or emotional stress. It typically goes away within minutes after stopping the stressful activity. In some people, especially women, this pain may be fleeting or sharp and noticed in the abdomen, back or arm.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortness of breath.&lt;/strong&gt; If your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue with exertion.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart attack.&lt;/strong&gt; If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked, you may have a heart attack. The classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing pressure in your chest and pain in your shoulder or arm, sometimes with shortness of breath and sweating. Women are somewhat more likely than men are to experience less typical signs and symptoms of a heart attack, including nausea and back or jaw pain. Sometimes a heart attack occurs without any apparent signs or symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you suspect you're having a heart attack, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only as a last resort. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have risk factors for coronary artery disease &amp;mdash; such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or obesity &amp;mdash; talk to your doctor. He or she may want to test you for the condition, especially if you have signs or symptoms of narrowed arteries. Even if you don't have evidence of coronary artery disease, your doctor may recommend aggressive treatment of your risk factors. Early diagnosis and treatment may stop progression of coronary artery disease and help prevent a heart attack. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Symptoms>
        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Risk factors for coronary artery disease include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age.&lt;/strong&gt; Simply getting older increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex.&lt;/strong&gt; Men are generally at greater risk of coronary artery disease. However, the risk for women increases after menopause.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history.&lt;/strong&gt; A family history of heart disease is associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a close relative developed heart disease at an early age. Your risk is highest if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before age 55, or your mother or a sister developed it before age 65.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking.&lt;/strong&gt; Nicotine constricts your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. The incidence of heart attack in women who smoke at least 20 cigarettes a day is six times that of women who've never smoked. For men who smoke, the incidence is triple that of nonsmokers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the channel through which blood can flow.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood cholesterol levels.&lt;/strong&gt; High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of formation of plaques and atherosclerosis. High cholesterol can be caused by a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), known as the "bad" cholesterol. A low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), known as the "good" cholesterol, also can promote atherosclerosis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetes.&lt;/strong&gt; Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity.&lt;/strong&gt; Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical inactivity.&lt;/strong&gt; Lack of exercise also is associated with coronary artery disease and some of its risk factors, as well.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High stress.&lt;/strong&gt; Unrelieved stress in your life may damage your arteries as well as worsen other risk factors for coronary artery disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Risk factors often occur in clusters and may build on one another, such as obesity leading to diabetes and high blood pressure. When grouped together, certain risk factors put you at an ever greater risk of coronary artery disease. For example, metabolic syndrome &amp;mdash; a cluster of conditions that includes elevated blood pressure, high triglycerides, elevated insulin levels and excess body fat around the waist &amp;mdash; increases the risk of coronary artery disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes coronary artery disease develops without any classic risk factors. Researchers are studying other possible factors, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep apnea.&lt;/strong&gt; This disorder causes you to repeatedly stop and start breathing while you're sleeping. Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during sleep apnea increase blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system, possibly leading to coronary artery disease.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C-reactive protein.&lt;/strong&gt; C-reactive protein (CRP) is a normal protein that appears in higher amounts when there's swelling somewhere in your body. High CRP levels may be a risk factor for heart disease. It's thought that as coronary arteries narrow, you'll have more CRP in your blood.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homocysteine.&lt;/strong&gt; Homocysteine is an amino acid your body uses to make protein and to build and maintain tissue. But high levels of homocysteine may increase your risk of coronary artery disease.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibrinogen.&lt;/strong&gt; Fibrinogen is a protein in your blood that plays a central role in blood clotting. But too much may increase clumping of platelets, the type of blood cell largely responsible for clotting. That can cause a clot to form in an artery, leading to a heart attack or stroke. Fibrinogen may also be an indicator of the inflammation that accompanies atherosclerosis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipoprotein (a).&lt;/strong&gt; This substance forms when a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle attaches to a specific protein. Lipoprotein (a) may disrupt your body's ability to dissolve blood clots. High levels of lipoprotein (a) may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Risk>
        <Complications Image="0">
          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Coronary artery disease can lead to: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest pain (angina).&lt;/strong&gt; When your coronary arteries narrow, your heart may not receive enough blood when demand is greatest &amp;mdash; particularly during physical activity. This can cause chest pain (angina) or shortness of breath.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart attack.&lt;/strong&gt; If a cholesterol plaque ruptures and a blood clot forms, complete blockage of your heart artery may trigger a heart attack. The lack of blood flow to your heart may damage to your heart muscle. The amount of damage depends in part on how quickly you receive treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart failure.&lt;/strong&gt; If some areas of your heart are chronically deprived of oxygen and nutrients because of reduced blood flow, or if your heart has been damaged by a heart attack, your heart may become too weak to pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. This condition is known as heart failure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia).&lt;/strong&gt; Inadequate blood supply to the heart or damage to heart tissue can interfere with your heart's electrical impulses, causing abnormal heart rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Complications>
        <Lifestyle Image="0">
          <Title>Lifestyle and home remedies</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Lifestyle changes can help you prevent or slow the progression of coronary artery disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop smoking.&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. Nicotine constricts blood vessels and forces your heart to work harder, and carbon monoxide reduces oxygen in your blood and damages the lining of your blood vessels. If you smoke, quitting is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of a heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control your blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; Ask your doctor for a blood pressure measurement at least every two years. He or she may recommend more frequent measurements if your blood pressure is higher than normal or you have a history of heart disease. The ideal blood pressure is below 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, as measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check your cholesterol.&lt;/strong&gt; Ask your doctor for a baseline cholesterol test when you're in your 20s and then at least every five years. If your test results aren't within desirable ranges, your doctor may recommend more frequent measurements. Most people should aim for an LDL level below 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.4 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). If you have other risk factors for heart disease, your target LDL may be below 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep diabetes under control.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have diabetes, tight blood sugar control can help reduce the risk of heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving.&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise helps you achieve and maintain a healthy weight and control diabetes, elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure &amp;mdash; all risk factors for coronary artery disease. With your doctor's OK, aim for 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most or all days of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat healthy foods.&lt;/strong&gt; A heart-healthy diet based on fruits, vegetables and whole grains &amp;mdash; and low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium &amp;mdash; can help you control your weight, blood pressure and cholesterol. Eating one or two servings of fish a week also is beneficial.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/strong&gt; Being overweight increases your risk of coronary artery disease. Losing even just a few pounds can help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of coronary artery disease.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress.&lt;/strong&gt; Reduce stress as much as possible. Practice healthy techniques for managing stress, such as muscle relaxation and deep breathing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to healthy lifestyle changes, remember the importance of regular medical checkups. Some of the main risk factors for coronary artery disease &amp;mdash; high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes &amp;mdash; have no symptoms in the early stages. Early detection and treatment can set the stage for a lifetime of better heart health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also ask your doctor about a yearly flu vaccine. Coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders increase the risk of complications from the flu.

      <Description>
        <Title>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</Title>
        <Text>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) refers to the development of a blood clot in a deep vein. DVT occurs most often in the legs. While the disease is asymptomatic, DVT may be detected through a number of non-specific symptoms that could include tenderness, swelling, discolouration and heat sensation in the affected area. Often the blood clots naturally dissolve. However, a significant health risk occurs when the clot migrates to the lung where it causes a pulmonary embolism (PE). The blockage of the major artery leading to the lung causes increased pressure on the right venticle of the heart and this is associated with typical clinical presentations of cyanosis, chest pains and heart palpitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your risk for DVT and PE is increased if you are above the age of 50, have had major surgery and/ or are obese. Sitting down for long periods of time, for example during a flight, may also increase the risk. Certain oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies are also associated within an increased risk for DVT. Pregnancy is another risk factor.</Text>

            <Caption>A blood clot in a leg vein may cause pain, warmth and tenderness in the affected area.</Caption>

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one or more of the deep veins in your body, usually in your legs. Deep vein thrombosis can cause leg pain, but often occurs without any symptoms. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Deep vein thrombosis can develop if you're sitting still for a long time, such as when traveling by plane or car, or if you have certain medical conditions that affect how your blood clots. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Deep vein thrombosis is a serious condition because a blood clot that has formed in your vein can break loose, travel through your bloodstream and lodge in your lungs, blocking blood flow (pulmonary embolism). 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Definition>
        <Causes Image="0">
          <Title>Causes</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Deep vein thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms in the veins that are deep in your body, often in your legs. Blood clots can be caused by many different things &amp;mdash; namely anything that causes your blood not to circulate normally or clot properly. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
In about half of all cases, deep vein thrombosis occurs without any noticeable symptoms. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When deep vein thrombosis symptoms occur, they can include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Swelling in the affected leg, including swelling in your ankle and foot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pain in your leg; this can include pain in your ankle and foot. The pain often starts in your calf and can feel like cramping or a charley horse.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Warmth over the affected area.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Changes in your skin color, such as turning pale, red or blue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you develop signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, contact your doctor for guidance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you develop signs or symptoms of a pulmonary embolism &amp;mdash; a life-threatening complication of deep vein thrombosis &amp;mdash; seek medical attention immediately. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The warning signs of a pulmonary embolism include:&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unexplained sudden onset of shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or discomfort that worsens when you take a deep breath or when you cough&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Feeling lightheaded or dizzy, or fainting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rapid pulse&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sweating&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A sense of anxiety or nervousness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Symptoms>
        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Many factors can increase your risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sitting for long periods of time, such as when driving or flying.&lt;/strong&gt; When your legs remain still for long periods, your calf muscles don't contract, which normally helps blood circulate. Blood clots can form in the calves of your legs if your calf muscles aren't moving. Although sitting for long periods is a risk factor, your chance of developing deep vein thrombosis while flying or driving is relatively low.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inheriting a blood-clotting disorder.&lt;/strong&gt; Some people inherit a disorder that makes their blood clot more easily. This inherited condition may not cause problems unless combined with one or more other risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prolonged bed rest, such as during a long hospital stay, or paralysis.&lt;/strong&gt; When your legs remain still for long periods, your calf muscles don't contract to help blood circulate, which can make blood clots develop.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injury or surgery.&lt;/strong&gt; Injury to your veins or surgery can slow blood flow, increasing the risk of blood clots. General anesthetics used during surgery can make your veins wider (dilate), which can increase the risk of blood pooling and then clotting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy.&lt;/strong&gt; Pregnancy increases the pressure in the veins in your pelvis and legs. Women with an inherited clotting disorder are especially at risk. The risk of blood clots from pregnancy can continue for up to six weeks after you have your baby.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer.&lt;/strong&gt; Some forms of cancer increase the amount of substances in your blood that cause your blood to clot. Some forms of cancer treatment also increase the risk of blood clots.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/strong&gt; Bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis, increases your risk of DVT.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart failure.&lt;/strong&gt; People with heart failure are at risk of DVT because a damaged heart doesn't pump blood as effectively as a normal heart does. This increases the chance that blood will pool and clot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy.&lt;/strong&gt; Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and hormone replacement therapy both can increase your blood's ability to clot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pacemaker or a thin, flexible tube (catheter) in a vein.&lt;/strong&gt; These medical treatments can irritate the blood vessel wall and decrease blood flow.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.&lt;/strong&gt; If you've had DVT before, you're more likely to have DVT in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.&lt;/strong&gt; If someone in your family has had DVT or a pulmonary embolism, your risk of developing DVT is increased.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being overweight or obese.&lt;/strong&gt; Being overweight increases the pressure in the veins in your pelvis and legs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking.&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking affects blood clotting and circulation, which can increase your risk of DVT.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age.&lt;/strong&gt; Being over age 60 increases your risk of DVT, though it can occur at any age.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being tall.&lt;/strong&gt; Taller men may be more likely to have blood clots. Taller women do not appear to have an increased risk, perhaps because most women do not typically get as tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>

The primary complication to be concerned with in deep vein thrombosis is a pulmonary embolism. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pulmonary embolism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood vessel in your lung becomes blocked by a blood clot (thrombus) that travels to your lungs from another part of your body, usually your leg. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A pulmonary embolism can be fatal. So, it's important to be on the lookout for signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism and seek medical attention if they occur. Signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unexplained sudden onset of shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or discomfort that worsens when you take a deep breath or when you cough&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Feeling lightheaded or dizzy, or fainting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rapid pulse&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sweating&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A sense of anxiety or nervousness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Postphlebitic syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A common complication that can occur after deep vein thrombosis is a condition known as postphlebitic syndrome, also called postthrombotic syndrome. This syndrome is used to describe a collection of signs and symptoms, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Swelling of your legs (edema)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Leg pain&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Skin discoloration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This syndrome is caused by damage to your veins from the blood clot. This damage reduces blood flow in the affected areas. The symptoms of postphlebitic syndrome may not occur until a few years after the DVT. Treatment options include medications, such as aspirin or diuretics, as well as the use of compression stockings. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

          <Title>Lifestyle and home remedies</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
The primary goal of your self-care plan should be preventing deep vein thrombosis from occurring. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To prevent deep vein thrombosis from worsening or happening again: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check in with your doctor regularly&lt;/strong&gt; to see if your medication or treatments need to be modified.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch how much vitamin K you're eating&lt;/strong&gt; if you take blood thinners. Vitamin K can affect how drugs such as warfarin work. Foods high in vitamin K include green leafy vegetables and canola and soybean oils.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise your lower calf muscles&lt;/strong&gt; if you'll be sitting a long time. Whenever possible, get up and walk around. If you can't get up to walk around, try raising and lowering your heels while keeping your toes on the floor, then raising your toes while your heels are on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move.&lt;/strong&gt; If you've been on bed rest, because of surgery or other factors, the sooner you get moving, the less likely blood clots will develop.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make lifestyle changes.&lt;/strong&gt; Lose weight, quit smoking and control your blood pressure. Obesity, smoking and high blood pressure all increase your risk of deep vein thrombosis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear compression stockings&lt;/strong&gt; to help prevent blood clots in the legs if your doctor recommends them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be on the lookout for excessive bleeding,&lt;/strong&gt; which can be a side effect of taking medications such as blood thinners. Talk to your doctor about activities that could cause you to bruise or get cut, as even a minor injury could become serious if you're taking blood thinners.&lt;/li&gt;

      <Description>
        <Title>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</Title>
        <Text>Familial hypercholesterolemia is a medical condition characterised by the accumulation of 'bad' fats, or low density lipids (LDL), in the blood. As a result, the cholesterol levels in the blood are elevated. It is a genetic condition that is passed down in families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome 19. It is inherited in the autosomal dominant fashion, requiring only one defective chromosome (from one parent) for the disease to develop. If both parents have the disorder, and have passed it down to the child, the disease will be more severe. High levels of cholesterol can cause the narrowing of arteries through the formation of plaques, which are deposits of cholesterol and cells in the arterial wall. Effectively, the blood vessels will become harder, thicker, and brittle, which can lead to many diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, heart attack, and stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Familial hypercholesterolemia can be managed through medications that include bile acid sequestrants and statins. You can confirm your genetic risks through a blood test that measures the levels of cholesterol in your blood. High cholesterol levels correspond to readings greater than 300 mg/dl blood in adults, where the levels of LDL are greater than 220 mg/dl.</Text>

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Cholesterol is a waxy substance that's found in the fats (lipids) in your blood. While your body needs cholesterol to continue building healthy cells, having high cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When you have high cholesterol, you may develop fatty deposits in your blood vessels. Eventually, these deposits make it difficult for enough blood to flow through your arteries. Your heart may not get as much oxygen-rich blood as it needs, which increases the risk of a heart attack. Decreased blood flow to your brain can cause a stroke.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
High cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) can be inherited, but is often preventable and treatable. A healthy diet, regular exercise and sometimes medication can go a long way toward reducing high cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

Cholesterol is carried through your blood, attached to proteins. This combination of proteins and cholesterol is called a lipoprotein. You may have heard of different types of cholesterol, based on what type of cholesterol the lipoprotein carries. They are:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-density lipoprotein (LDL).&lt;/strong&gt; LDL, or "bad," cholesterol transports cholesterol particles throughout your body. LDL cholesterol builds up in the walls of your arteries, making them hard and narrow.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).&lt;/strong&gt; This type of lipoprotein contains the most triglycerides, a type of fat, attached to the proteins in your blood. VLDL cholesterol makes LDL cholesterol larger in size, causing your blood vessels to narrow. If you're taking cholesterol-lowering medication but have a high VLDL level, you may need additional medication to lower your triglycerides.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-density lipoprotein (HDL).&lt;/strong&gt; HDL, or "good," cholesterol picks up excess cholesterol and takes it back to your liver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Factors within your control &amp;mdash; such as inactivity, obesity and an unhealthy diet &amp;mdash; contribute to high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol. Factors beyond your control may play a role, too. For example, your genetic makeup may keep cells from removing LDL cholesterol from your blood efficiently or cause your liver to produce too much cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
High cholesterol has no symptoms. A blood test is the only way to detect high cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ask your doctor for a baseline cholesterol test at age 20 and then have your cholesterol retested at least every five years. If your test results aren't within desirable ranges, your doctor may recommend more frequent measurements. Your doctor may also suggest you have more frequent tests if you have a family history of high cholesterol, heart disease or other risk factors, like smoking, diabetes or high blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
You're more likely to have high cholesterol that can lead to heart disease if you have any of these risk factors:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking.&lt;/strong&gt; Cigarette smoking damages the walls of your blood vessels, making them likely to accumulate fatty deposits. Smoking may also lower your level of HDL, or "good," cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater puts you at risk of high cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor diet.&lt;/strong&gt; Foods that are high in cholesterol, such as red meat and full-fat dairy products, will increase your total cholesterol. Eating saturated fat, found in animal products, and trans fats, found in some commercially baked cookies and crackers, also can raise your cholesterol level.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise helps boost your body's HDL "good" cholesterol while lowering your LDL "bad" cholesterol. Not getting enough exercise puts you at risk of high cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; Increased pressure on your artery walls damages your arteries, which can speed the accumulation of fatty deposits.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetes.&lt;/strong&gt; High blood sugar contributes to higher LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol. High blood sugar also damages the lining of your arteries.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history of heart disease.&lt;/strong&gt; If a parent or sibling developed heart disease before age 55, high cholesterol levels place you at a greater than average risk of developing heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;

High cholesterol can cause atherosclerosis, a dangerous accumulation of cholesterol and other deposits on the walls of your arteries. These deposits &amp;mdash; called plaques &amp;mdash; can reduce blood flow through your arteries, which can cause complications, such as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest pain.&lt;/strong&gt; If the arteries that supply your heart with blood (coronary arteries) are affected, you may have chest pain (angina) and other symptoms of coronary artery disease.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart attack.&lt;/strong&gt; If plaques tear or rupture, a blood clot may form at the plaque-rupture site &amp;mdash; blocking the flow of blood or breaking free and plugging an artery downstream. If blood flow to part of your heart stops, you'll have a heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stroke.&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to a heart attack, if blood flow to part of your brain is blocked by a blood clot, a stroke occurs.&lt;/li&gt;

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Lifestyle changes are essential to improve your cholesterol level. To bring your numbers down, lose excess weight, eat healthy foods and increase your physical activity. If you smoke, quit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lose extra pounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Excess weight contributes to high cholesterol. Losing even 5 to 10 pounds can help lower total cholesterol levels. Start by taking an honest look at your eating habits and daily routine. Consider your challenges to weight loss &amp;mdash; and ways to overcome them. Set long-term, sustainable goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Eat heart-healthy foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What you eat has a direct impact on your cholesterol level. In fact, a diet rich in fiber and other cholesterol-lowering foods may help lower cholesterol as much as statin medication for some people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose healthier fats.&lt;/strong&gt; Saturated fat and trans fat raise your total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Get no more than 10 percent of your daily calories from saturated fat. Monounsaturated fat &amp;mdash; found in olive, peanut and canola oils &amp;mdash; is a healthier option. Almonds and walnuts are other sources of healthy fat.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate trans fats.&lt;/strong&gt; Trans fats, which are often found in margarines and commercially baked cookies, crackers and snack cakes, are particularly bad for your cholesterol levels. Not only do trans fats increase your total LDL ("bad") cholesterol, but they also lower your HDL ("good") cholesterol.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
	You may have noticed more food labels now market their products as "trans fat-free." But don't rely only on this label. In the United States, if a food contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fat a serving, it can be marked trans fat-free. It may not seem like much, but if you eat a lot of foods with a small amount of trans fat, it can add up quickly. Instead, read the ingredients list. If a food contains a partially hydrogenated oil, that's a trans fat, and you should look for an alternative.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit your dietary cholesterol.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for no more than 300 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol a day &amp;mdash; or less than 200 mg if you have heart disease. The most concentrated sources of cholesterol include organ meats, egg yolks and whole milk products. Use lean cuts of meat, egg substitutes and skim milk instead.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select whole grains.&lt;/strong&gt; Various nutrients found in whole grains promote heart health. Choose whole-grain breads, whole-wheat pasta, whole-wheat flour and brown rice. Oatmeal and oat bran are other good choices.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock up on fruits and vegetables.&lt;/strong&gt; Fruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fiber, which can help lower cholesterol. Snack on seasonal fruits. Experiment with vegetable-based casseroles, soups and stir-fries.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat heart-healthy fish.&lt;/strong&gt; Some types of fish &amp;mdash; such as cod, tuna and halibut &amp;mdash; have less total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol than do meat and poultry. Salmon, mackerel and herring are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help promote heart health.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink alcohol only in moderation.&lt;/strong&gt; Moderate use of alcohol may increase your levels of HDL cholesterol &amp;mdash; but the benefits aren't strong enough to recommend alcohol for anyone who doesn't drink already. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation. This means no more than one drink a day for women and one to two drinks a day for men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Regular exercise can help improve your cholesterol levels. With your doctor's OK, work up to 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. Take a brisk daily walk. Ride your bike. Swim laps. To maintain your motivation, keep it fun. Find an exercise buddy or join an exercise group. And, you don't need to get all 30 to 60 minutes in one exercise session. If you can squeeze in three to six 10-minute intervals of exercise, you'll still get some cholesterol-lowering benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don't smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you smoke, stop. Quitting can improve your HDL cholesterol level. And the benefits don't end there. Just 20 minutes after quitting, your blood pressure decreases. Within 24 hours, your risk of a heart attack decreases. Within one year, your risk of heart disease is half that of a smoker's. Within 15 years, your risk of heart disease is similar to that of someone who's never smoked.

        <Title>Heart Attack</Title>
        <Text>The rupture or dislodging of an atherosclerotic plaque can cause an occlusion of the coronary artery that supplies blood to a part of the heart. The resulting blockage leads to a shortage in oxygen supply which can cause damage to the heart. In more severe cases death of parts of the heart muscle occurs. Symptoms include chest pains, shortness of breath, nausea and anxiety, although many heart attacks are asymptomatic. Risk factors for heart attacks include gender, other underlying cardiovascular diseases, age, smoking, high LDL levels, diabetes, blood pressure, obesity and alcohol consumption. The risk of a heart attack occurring increases with exertion that may be either physical or psychological. This increased risk could be six times higher for physcially fit individuals, and as much as 35 times higher for unfit individuals. This may be a result of the increased stretching of the vasculature that leads to the dislodging of atheromatous plaques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heart attacks can be prevented by maintaining healthy blood pressure levels and making lifestyle changes that include quitting smoking, taking regular exercise and adopting a balanced diet. Taking prescribed antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, beta-blockers and statins can also help.</Text>

A heart attack usually occurs when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood through a coronary artery &amp;mdash; a blood vessel that feeds blood to a part of the heart muscle. Interrupted blood flow to your heart can damage or destroy a part of the heart muscle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal. This is often because people confuse their symptoms with a minor illness, like indigestion, and delay going to the hospital. They try to tough out their symptoms and receive treatment too late. Treatment for heart attack has improved dramatically over the years. It is crucial to promptly recognize symptoms and call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your overall lifestyle &amp;mdash; what you eat, how often you exercise and the way you deal with stress &amp;mdash; plays a role in your recovery from a heart attack. In addition, a healthy lifestyle can help you prevent a heart attack by controlling risk factors that contribute to the narrowing of the coronary arteries that supply blood to your heart. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Caption>A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying your heart with blood and oxygen becomes blocked. Fatty deposits build up over time, forming plaques in your heart's arteries (A). The plaques build over time (B). If the deposits rupture, a blood clot can form (C) and eventually completely block your arteries, causing a heart attack. During a heart attack, tissue in your heart muscle dies due to lack of blood flow through your heart's arteries (D).</Caption>

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
A heart attack occurs when one or more of the arteries supplying your heart with oxygen-rich blood (coronary arteries) become blocked. Over time, a coronary artery can become narrowed from the buildup of cholesterol. This buildup &amp;mdash; collectively known as plaques &amp;mdash; in arteries throughout the body is called atherosclerosis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During a heart attack, one of these plaques can rupture and a blood clot forms on the site of the rupture. If the clot is large enough, it can completely block the flow of blood through the artery. When your coronary arteries have narrowed due to atherosclerosis, the condition is known as coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is the underlying cause of most heart attacks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An uncommon cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Drugs, such as cocaine, can cause such a life-threatening spasm. A heart attack can also occur due to a tear in the heart artery (coronary artery dissection). Other uncommon causes of heart attack include small blood clots or tumors that have traveled from other parts of the body (coronary embolism). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A heart attack is the end of a process that typically evolves over several hours. With each passing minute, more heart tissue is deprived of blood and deteriorates or dies. However, if blood flow can be restored in time, damage to the heart can be limited or prevented. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Common heart attack symptoms include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pressure, a feeling of fullness or a squeezing pain in the center of your chest that lasts for more than a few minutes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pain extending beyond your chest to your shoulder, arm, back, or even to your teeth and jaw&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increasing episodes of chest pain&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prolonged pain in the upper abdomen&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sweating&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Impending sense of doom&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fainting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nausea and vomiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Additional, or different, heart attack signs and symptoms in women may include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heartburn or abdominal pain&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Clammy skin&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lightheadedness or dizziness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unusual or unexplained fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Heart attack symptoms vary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not all people who have heart attacks experience the same symptoms or experience them to the same degree. Many heart attacks aren't as dramatic as the ones you've seen on TV. Some people have no symptoms at all. Still, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood that you may be having a heart attack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A heart attack can occur anytime &amp;mdash; at work or play, while you're resting, or while you're in motion. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people who experience a heart attack have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning of a heart attack may be recurrent chest pain (angina) that's triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many people confuse a heart attack with a condition in which your heart suddenly stops (sudden cardiac arrest). Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when an electrical disturbance in your heart disrupts its pumping action and causes blood to stop flowing to the rest of your body. Heart attack is the most common cause, but not the only cause, of cardiac arrest. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During a heart attack, act immediately. Many people wait too long because they don't recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for emergency medical help.&lt;/strong&gt; If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only as a last resort, if there are absolutely no other options. Driving yourself puts you and others at risk if your condition suddenly worsens.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed.&lt;/strong&gt; If your doctor has prescribed nitroglycerin, take it as instructed while awaiting the arrival of emergency medical personnel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take aspirin, if recommended.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're concerned about your heart attack risk, ask your doctor if chewing an aspirin tablet if you have heart attack symptoms is a good idea. Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce the damage to your heart by making your blood less likely to clot. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don't take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don't delay calling 911, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you see someone having a heart attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you encounter someone who is unconscious from a presumed heart attack, call for emergency medical help. If you have received training in emergency procedures, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This helps deliver oxygen to the body and brain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to guidelines by the American Heart Association, regardless of whether you've been trained, you should begin CPR with chest compressions. Press down about two inches (about five centimeters) on the person's chest for each compression at a rate of about 100 a minute. If you've been trained in CPR, check the person's airway and deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions. If you haven't been trained, continue doing compressions only. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the initial minutes, a heart attack can also trigger ventricular fibrillation, a condition in which the heart quivers uselessly. Without immediate treatment, ventricular fibrillation leads to sudden death. The timely use of an automatic external defibrillator (AED), which shocks the heart back into a normal rhythm, can provide emergency treatment before a person having a heart attack reaches the hospital. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Symptoms>
        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Certain factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body, including arteries to your heart. You can improve or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or subsequent heart attack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Heart attack risk factors include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age.&lt;/strong&gt; Men who are 45 or older and women who are 55 or older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tobacco.&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke damage the interior walls of arteries &amp;mdash; including arteries to your heart &amp;mdash; allowing deposits of cholesterol and other substances to collect and slow blood flow. Smoking also increases the risk of deadly blood clots forming and causing a heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetes.&lt;/strong&gt; Diabetes is the inability of your body to adequately produce insulin or respond to insulin need properly. Insulin, a hormone secreted by your pancreas, allows your body to use glucose, which is a form of sugar from foods. Diabetes can occur in childhood, but it appears more often in middle age and among overweight people. Diabetes greatly increases your risk of a heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart by accelerating atherosclerosis. The risk of high blood pressure increases as you age, but the main culprits for most people are eating a diet too high in salt and being overweight. High blood pressure can also be an inherited problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels.&lt;/strong&gt; Cholesterol is a major part of the deposits that can narrow arteries throughout your body, including those that supply your heart. A high level of the wrong kind of cholesterol in your blood increases your risk of a heart attack. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high LDL level is undesirable and is often a result of a diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also is undesirable. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol), which helps the body clean up excess cholesterol, is desirable and lowers your risk of heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history of heart attack.&lt;/strong&gt; If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had heart attacks, you may be at increased risk. Your family may have a genetic condition that raises unwanted blood cholesterol levels. High blood pressure also can run in families.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of physical activity.&lt;/strong&gt; An inactive lifestyle contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity. People who get regular aerobic exercise have better cardiovascular fitness, which decreases their overall risk of heart attack. Exercise is also beneficial in lowering high blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity.&lt;/strong&gt; Obese people have a high proportion of body fat (a body mass index of 30 or higher). Obesity raises the risk of heart disease because it's associated with high blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress.&lt;/strong&gt; You may respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack. If you're under stress, you may overeat or smoke from nervous tension. Too much stress, as well as anger, can also raise your blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illegal drug use.&lt;/strong&gt; Using stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, can trigger a spasm of your coronary arteries that can cause a heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;

          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Heart attack complications are often related to the damage done to your heart during a heart attack. This damage can lead to the following conditions: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).&lt;/strong&gt; If your heart muscle is damaged from a heart attack, electrical "short circuits" can develop, resulting in abnormal heart rhythms, some of which can be serious, even fatal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart failure.&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of damaged tissue in your heart may be so great that the remaining heart muscle can't do an adequate job of pumping blood out of your heart. This decreases blood flow to tissues and organs throughout your body and may produce shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in your ankles and feet. Heart failure may be a temporary problem that goes away after your heart, which has been stunned by a heart attack, recovers over a few days to weeks. However, it can also be a chronic condition resulting from extensive and permanent damage to your heart following your heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart rupture.&lt;/strong&gt; Areas of heart muscle weakened by a heart attack can rupture, leaving a hole in part of the heart. This rupture is often fatal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valve problems.&lt;/strong&gt; Heart valves damaged during a heart attack may develop severe, life-threatening leakage problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
How you live your life affects the health of your heart. Taking the following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't smoke.&lt;/strong&gt; If you smoke, the single most important thing you can do to improve your heart's health is to stop. It's hard to stop smoking by yourself, so ask your doctor to prescribe a treatment plan to help you kick the habit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid secondhand smoke.&lt;/strong&gt; Being around secondhand smoke can potentially trigger a heart attack, since many of the chemicals in cigarettes that can damage your arteries are also in secondhand smoke.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check your cholesterol.&lt;/strong&gt; Have your blood cholesterol levels checked regularly, through a blood test at your doctor's office. If "bad" cholesterol levels are undesirably high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications to help lower the numbers and protect your cardiovascular health. How frequently you'll need your cholesterol checked depends on how high your cholesterol is. People who have high cholesterol may need more-frequent tests.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get regular medical checkups.&lt;/strong&gt; Some of the major risk factors for heart attack &amp;mdash; high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes &amp;mdash; cause no symptoms in their early stages. Your doctor can perform tests to check that you're free of these conditions. If a problem exists, you and your doctor can manage it early to prevent complications that can lead to a heart attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control your blood pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; Have your blood pressure checked every two years. Your doctor may recommend more frequent measurement if you have high blood pressure or a history of coronary artery disease.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function following a heart attack. Exercise is a major part of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Exercise helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to achieve and maintain a healthy weight and control diabetes, elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure. Exercise doesn't have to be vigorous. For example, walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/strong&gt; Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. Losing weight can lower your risk of heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a heart-healthy diet.&lt;/strong&gt; Too much saturated fat and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart. If you've had a heart attack, limit fat and cholesterol &amp;mdash; and salt. A diet high in salt can raise your blood pressure. Follow your doctor's and dietitian's advice on eating a heart-healthy diet. Prepare heart-healthy meals together as a family. Fish is part of a heart-healthy diet. It contains omega-3 fatty acids, which help improve blood cholesterol levels and prevent blood clots. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants &amp;mdash; nutrients that help prevent everyday wear and tear on your coronary arteries.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress.&lt;/strong&gt; To reduce your risk of a heart attack, reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation.&lt;/strong&gt; You shouldn't start drinking alcohol if you already opt not to. But, in moderation, alcohol helps raise HDL levels &amp;mdash; the "good" cholesterol &amp;mdash; and can have a protective effect against heart attack. Men should have no more than two drinks a day, and women should have no more than one. Excessive drinking can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, increasing your risk of heart attack. Drinking more than one to two alcoholic drinks a day raises blood pressure, so cut back on your drinking if necessary. One drink is equivalent to 12 ounces (355 milliliters, or mL) of beer, 4 ounces (118 mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (44 mL) of an 80-proof liquor.&lt;/li&gt;

      <Description>
        <Title>Hypertension</Title>
        <Text>Hypertension or high blood pressure refers to chronic elevated blood pressure in the arteries. Hypertension is a serious risk factor for other major cardiovascular complications such as stroke, heart attack, heart failure, aortic aneurysms, peripheral arterial disease and kidney disease. Reducing one's blood pressure can greatly reduce the risk of stroke, heart disease and even dementia. To avoid hypertension it is necessary to maintain a normal body weight, reduce intake of salt in food and exercise regularly. Diet should be rich in fruits and vegetables, contain as little alcohol as possible and be free from saturated fats. Hypertension can also be controlled through the use of medication.</Text>

          <Title>Definition</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
High blood pressure is a common condition in which the force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can have high blood pressure (hypertension) for years without any symptoms. Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases your risk of serious health problems, including heart attack and stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
High blood pressure typically develops over many years, and it affects nearly everyone eventually. Fortunately, high blood pressure can be easily detected. And once you know you have high blood pressure, you can work with your doctor to control it. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Definition>
        <Causes Image="0">
          <Title>Causes</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
There are two types of high blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Primary (essential) hypertension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For most adults, there's no identifiable cause of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure, called essential hypertension or primary hypertension, tends to develop gradually over many years. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Secondary hypertension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some people have high blood pressure caused by an underlying condition. This type of high blood pressure, called secondary hypertension, tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does primary hypertension. Various conditions and medications can lead to secondary hypertension, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Kidney problems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adrenal gland tumors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Certain defects in blood vessels you're born with (congenital)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Certain medications, such as birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Most people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although a few people with early-stage high blood pressure may have dull headaches, dizzy spells or a few more nosebleeds than normal, these signs and symptoms typically don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe &amp;mdash; even life-threatening &amp;mdash; stage. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You'll likely have your blood pressure taken as part of a routine doctor's appointment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18. He or she will likely recommend more frequent readings if you've already been diagnosed with high blood pressure or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Children age 3 and older will usually have their blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you don't regularly see your doctor, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community. You can also find machines in some stores that will measure your blood pressure for free, but these machines can give you inaccurate results. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Symptoms>
        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
High blood pressure has many risk factors, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age.&lt;/strong&gt; The risk of high blood pressure increases as you age. Through early middle age, high blood pressure is more common in men. Women are more likely to develop high blood pressure after menopause.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race.&lt;/strong&gt; High blood pressure is particularly common among blacks, often developing at an earlier age than it does in whites. Serious complications, such as stroke and heart attack, also are more common in blacks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history.&lt;/strong&gt; High blood pressure tends to run in families.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being overweight or obese.&lt;/strong&gt; The more you weigh, the more blood you need to supply oxygen and nutrients to your tissues. As the volume of blood circulated through your blood vessels increases, so does the pressure on your artery walls.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not being physically active.&lt;/strong&gt; People who are inactive tend to have higher heart rates. The higher your heart rate, the harder your heart must work with each contraction &amp;mdash; and the stronger the force on your arteries. Lack of physical activity also increases the risk of being overweight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using tobacco.&lt;/strong&gt; Not only does smoking or chewing tobacco immediately raise your blood pressure temporarily, but the chemicals in tobacco can damage the lining of your artery walls. This can cause your arteries to narrow, increasing your blood pressure. Secondhand smoke also can increase your blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much salt (sodium) in your diet.&lt;/strong&gt; Too much sodium in your diet can cause your body to retain fluid, which increases blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too little potassium in your diet.&lt;/strong&gt; Potassium helps balance the amount of sodium in your cells. If you don't get enough potassium in your diet or retain enough potassium, you may accumulate too much sodium in your blood.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too little vitamin D in your diet.&lt;/strong&gt; It's uncertain if having too little vitamin D in your diet can lead to high blood pressure. Vitamin D may affect an enzyme produced by your kidneys that affects your blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking too much alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt; Over time, heavy drinking can damage your heart. Having more than two drinks a day can raise your blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress.&lt;/strong&gt; High levels of stress can lead to a temporary, but dramatic, increase in blood pressure. If you try to relax by eating more, using tobacco or drinking alcohol, you may only increase problems with high blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain chronic conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; Certain chronic conditions also may increase your risk of high blood pressure, including high cholesterol, diabetes, kidney disease and sleep apnea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes pregnancy contributes to high blood pressure, as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although high blood pressure is most common in adults, children may be at risk, too. For some children, high blood pressure is caused by problems with the kidneys or heart. But for a growing number of kids, poor lifestyle habits &amp;mdash; such as an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise &amp;mdash; contribute to high blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

        <Complications Image="0">
          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
The excessive pressure on your artery walls caused by high blood pressure can damage your blood vessels, as well as organs in your body. The higher your blood pressure and the longer it goes uncontrolled, the greater the damage. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart attack or stroke.&lt;/strong&gt; High blood pressure can cause hardening and thickening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), which can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other complications.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aneurysm.&lt;/strong&gt; Increased blood pressure can cause your blood vessels to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm. If an aneurysm ruptures, it can be life-threatening.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart failure.&lt;/strong&gt; To pump blood against the higher pressure in your vessels, your heart muscle thickens. Eventually, the thickened muscle may have a hard time pumping enough blood to meet your body's needs, which can lead to heart failure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakened and narrowed blood vessels in your kidneys.&lt;/strong&gt; This can prevent these organs from functioning normally.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thickened, narrowed or torn blood vessels in the eyes.&lt;/strong&gt; This can result in vision loss.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic syndrome.&lt;/strong&gt; This syndrome is a cluster of disorders of your body's metabolism &amp;mdash; including increased waist circumference, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good," cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high insulin levels. If you have high blood pressure, you're more likely to have other components of metabolic syndrome. The more components you have, the greater your risk of developing diabetes, heart disease or stroke.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trouble with memory or understanding.&lt;/strong&gt; Uncontrolled high blood pressure may also affect your ability to think, remember and learn. Trouble with memory or understanding concepts is more common in people who have high blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>

        <Lifestyle Image="0">
          <Title>Lifestyle and home remedies</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Lifestyle changes can help you control and prevent high blood pressure &amp;mdash; even if you're taking blood pressure medication. Here's what you can do: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat healthy foods.&lt;/strong&gt; Try the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy foods. Get plenty of potassium, which can help prevent and control high blood pressure. Eat less saturated fat and total fat.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decrease the salt in your diet.&lt;/strong&gt; A lower sodium level &amp;mdash; 1,500 milligrams (mg) a day &amp;mdash; is appropriate for people 51 years of age or older, and individuals of any age who are African-American or who have hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease. Otherwise healthy people can aim for 2,300 mg a day or less. While you can reduce the amount of salt you eat by putting down the saltshaker, you should also pay attention to the amount of salt that's in the processed foods you eat, such as canned soups or frozen dinners.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're overweight, losing even 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) can lower your blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase physical activity.&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity can help lower your blood pressure and keep your weight under control. Strive for at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you're healthy, alcohol can raise your blood pressure. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation &amp;mdash; up to one drink a day for women and everyone older than age 65, and two drinks a day for men.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't smoke.&lt;/strong&gt; Tobacco injures blood vessel walls and speeds up the process of hardening of the arteries. If you smoke, ask your doctor to help you quit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress.&lt;/strong&gt; Reduce stress as much as possible. Practice healthy coping techniques, such as muscle relaxation and deep breathing. Getting plenty of sleep can help, too.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor your blood pressure at home.&lt;/strong&gt; Home blood pressure monitoring can help you keep closer tabs on your blood pressure, show if medication is working, and even alert you and your doctor to potential complications. If your blood pressure is under control, you may be able to make fewer visits to your doctor if you monitor your blood pressure at home.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice relaxation or slow, deep breathing.&lt;/strong&gt; Practice taking deep, slow breaths to help relax. There are some devices available that can help guide your breathing for relaxation; however, it's questionable whether these devices have a significant effect on lowering your blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>Hypertriglyceridemia</Title>
        <Text>Familial hypertriglyceridemia is a genetic disease affecting the metabolism of fats. It is characterised by increased level of triglycerides in the blood. The triglycerides represent a type of organic fat used by the human body to store energy. They are usually transported through the blood in the form of very low density lipids (VLDL), where they are packed together with proteins for solubility. Individuals with this medical condition are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and stroke. It has also been reported that higher triglyceride levels in the blood can cause pancreatitis. Familial hypertriglyceridemia is a genetic disorder that is passed down as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that a child can inherit the disease even if only one parent has the genetic defect. In the event both parents are affected, the disease will show up in the child earlier in life and be more severe. Similar to high levels of cholesterol, elevated triglycerides can cause narrowing of blood vessels through the formation of fatty deposits in the arterial wall. The deposits will also make the walls harder, thicker and brittle, thus predisposing the walls to increased blood pressure and breakages as seen in a haemorrhagic stroke. There are very few symptoms that can be related specifically to familial hypertriglyceridemia. More often than not, an individual will show symptoms associated with cardiovascular diseases including shortness of breath, chest pain and tiredness on physical exertion. Prevention includes avoiding foods rich in saturated fats, reducing intake of refined carbohydrates and maintaining an active lifestyle with regular exercise.</Text>

Familial hypertriglyceridemia is a genetic disorder that is passed down as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that a child can inherit the disease even if only one parent has the genetic defect. In the event both parents are affected, the disease will show up in the child earlier in life and be more severe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The genetic defect causes a change in one of the cell receptors responsible for the absorption of triglycerides from blood. The defect also causes a higher production of triglycerides in the liver. As a result the VLDL level in the blood is substantially elevated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Similar to high levels of cholesterol, elevated triglycerides can cause narrowing of blood vessels through the formation of fatty deposits in the arterial wall. The deposits will also make the walls harder, thicker and brittle, thus predisposing the walls to increased blood pressure and breakages as seen in a haemorrhagic stroke.

Obesity is defined as having an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity is more than just a cosmetic concern, though. It increases your risk of diseases and health problems such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Being extremely obese means you are especially likely to have health problems related to your weight. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity. You can usually lose weight through dietary changes, increased physical activity and behavior changes. In some cases, prescription medications or weight-loss surgery may be options. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

Although there are genetic and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through exercise and normal daily activities. Your body stores these excess calories as fat. Obesity usually results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactivity.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're not very active, you don't burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you use through exercise and normal daily activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unhealthy diet and eating habits.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a diet that's high in calories, eating fast food, skipping breakfast, eating most of your calories at night, drinking high-calorie beverages and eating oversized portions all contribute to weight gain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy.&lt;/strong&gt; During pregnancy, a woman's weight necessarily increases. Some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; Getting less than seven hours of sleep a night can cause changes in hormones that increase your appetite. You may also crave foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain medications.&lt;/strong&gt; Some medications can lead to weight gain if you don't compensate through diet or activity. These medications include some antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, diabetes medications, antipsychotic medications, steroids and beta blockers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical problems.&lt;/strong&gt; Obesity can sometimes be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and other diseases and conditions. Some medical problems, such as arthritis, can lead to decreased activity, which may result in weight gain. A low metabolism is unlikely to cause obesity, as is having low thyroid function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Obesity is diagnosed when an individual's body mass index (BMI) is 30 or higher. Your body mass index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms (kg) by your height in meters (m) squared. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="mctable"&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" class="content"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;th width="50%"&gt;BMI&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th width="50%"&gt;Weight status&lt;/th&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Below 18.5&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Underweight&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;18.5 &amp;mdash; 24.9&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Normal&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;25.0 &amp;mdash; 29.9&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Overweight&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;30.0 and higher&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Obese&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;40.0 and higher&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Extreme obesity&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because BMI doesn't directly measure body fat, some people, such as muscular athletes, may have a BMI in the obese category even though they don't have excess body fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you think you may be obese, and especially if you're concerned about weight-related health problems, see your doctor or health care provider. You and your doctor can evaluate your health risks and discuss your weight-loss options. Even modest weight loss can lessen or prevent problems related to obesity. Weight loss is usually possible through dietary changes, increased physical activity and behavior changes. In some cases, prescription medications or weight-loss surgery may be options. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Obesity occurs when you eat and drink more calories than you burn through exercise and normal daily activities. Your body stores these extra calories as fat. Obesity usually results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetics.&lt;/strong&gt; Your genes may affect the amount of body fat you store and where that fat is distributed. Genetics may also play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy and how your body burns calories during exercise. Even when someone has a genetic predisposition, environmental factors ultimately make you gain more weight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactivity.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're not very active, you don't burn as many calories. With a sedentary lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you burn off through exercise and normal daily activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unhealthy diet and eating habits.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a diet that's high in calories, eating fast food, skipping breakfast, consuming high-calorie drinks and eating oversized portions all contribute to weight gain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family lifestyle.&lt;/strong&gt; Obesity tends to run in families. That's not just because of genetics. Family members tend to have similar eating, lifestyle and activity habits. If one or both of your parents are obese, your risk of being obese is increased.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quitting smoking.&lt;/strong&gt; Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. And for some, it can lead to a weight gain of as much as several pounds a week for several months, which can result in obesity. In the long run, however, quitting smoking is still a greater benefit to your health than continuing to smoke.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy.&lt;/strong&gt; During pregnancy a woman's weight necessarily increases. Some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; Not getting enough sleep at night can cause changes in hormones that increase your appetite. You may also crave foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain medications.&lt;/strong&gt; Some medications can lead to weight gain if you don't compensate through diet or activity. These medications include some antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, diabetes medications, antipsychotic medications, steroids and beta blockers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age.&lt;/strong&gt; Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. But as you age, hormonal changes and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity. In addition, the amount of muscle in your body tends to decrease with age. This lower muscle mass leads to a decrease in metabolism. These changes also reduce calorie needs and can make it harder to keep off excess weight. If you don't control what you eat as you age, you'll likely gain weight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social and economic issues.&lt;/strong&gt; Certain social and economic issues may be linked to obesity. You may not have safe areas to exercise, you may not have been taught healthy ways of cooking, or you may not have money to buy healthier foods. In addition, the people you spend time with may influence your weight &amp;mdash; you're more likely to become obese if you have obese friends or relatives.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical problems.&lt;/strong&gt; Obesity can rarely be traced to a medical cause, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and other diseases and conditions. Some medical problems, such as arthritis, can lead to decreased activity, which may result in weight gain. A low metabolism is unlikely to cause obesity, as is having low thyroid function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if you have one or more of these risk factors, it doesn't mean that you're destined to become obese. You can counteract most risk factors through diet, physical activity and exercise, and behavior changes. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Risk>
        <Complications Image="0">
          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
If you're obese, you're more likely to develop a number of potentially serious health problems, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High cholesterol and triglycerides&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Metabolic syndrome &amp;mdash; a combination of high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and high cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heart disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stroke&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cancer, including cancer of the uterus, cervix, ovaries, breast, colon, rectum and prostate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sleep apnea, a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Depression&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gynecologic problems, such as infertility and irregular periods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Erectile dysfunction and sexual health issues, due to deposits of fat blocking or narrowing the arteries to the genitals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition in which fat builds up in the liver and can cause inflammation or scarring&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Osteoarthritis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Skin problems, such as poor wound healing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Quality of life&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
When you're obese, your overall quality of life may be lower, too. You may not be able to do things you'd normally enjoy as easily as you'd like. You may have trouble participating in family activities. You may avoid public places. You may even encounter discrimination. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other weight-related issues that may affect your quality of life include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Depression&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Disability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Physical discomfort&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sexual problems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shame&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Social isolation&lt;/li&gt;

          <Title>Lifestyle and home remedies</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Your effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful it you follow strategies at home in addition to your formal treatment plan. These can include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stick to your treatment plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be difficult. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care providers if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your medications as directed.&lt;/strong&gt; If you take weight-loss medications or medications to treat obesity-related conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, take them exactly as prescribed. If you have a problem sticking with your medication regimen or have unpleasant side effects, talk to your doctor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn about your condition.&lt;/strong&gt; Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you became obese and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your doctor or therapist.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist support.&lt;/strong&gt; Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You might also want to join a weight-loss support group.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set realistic goals.&lt;/strong&gt; When you have to lose a significant amount of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify and avoid food triggers.&lt;/strong&gt; Distract yourself from your desire to eat with something positive, such as calling a friend. Practice saying no to unhealthy foods and big portions. Eat when you're actually hungry &amp;mdash; not simply when the clock says it's time to eat.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a record.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep a food and activity journal. This journal can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover behavior that may be holding you back and, conversely, what works well for you. You can also use the journal to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels and overall fitness.&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>Peripheral Arterial Disease</Title>
        <Text>Peripheral arterial disease, or peripheral vascular disease, refers to the blockage and narrowing of the large arteries that are outside of the heart, brain and aorta. The disease is classified based on claudication, a pain usually observed in males aged 50 and above, while they are walking. The pain is a consequence of restricted blood flow to the leg muscles. As the disease becomes more severe the pain becomes worse, even when resting, and gangrene may occur. Symptoms such as weakness, numbness or cramping of the leg muscles may be observed. The development of sores and ulcers on the legs that heal poorly may also be an indication. Other indications include reduced hair and nail growth on the affected limb. Ischemic muscle pain is one of the most common manifestations of the disease which is directly caused by atherosclerosis. A common consequence of peripheral arterial disease is amputation of the affected limb. Risk factors include smoking, hypertension and diabetes.</Text>

            <Caption>In peripheral artery disease, the arteries that supply blood to the legs are narrowed, typically because of atherosclerosis, causing a cluster of pain symptoms called intermittent claudication. With proper treatment, new, collateral blood vessels may form, allowing blood to circulate around the damaged areas.</Caption>
          </Image>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Peripheral artery disease (also called peripheral arterial disease) is a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to your limbs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When you develop peripheral artery disease (PAD), your extremities &amp;mdash; usually your legs &amp;mdash; don't receive enough blood flow to keep up with demand. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking (intermittent claudication). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Peripheral artery disease is also likely to be a sign of a more widespread accumulation of fatty deposits in your arteries (atherosclerosis). This condition may be reducing blood flow to your heart and brain, as well as your legs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Often, you can successfully treat peripheral artery disease by quitting tobacco, exercising and eating a healthy diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Definition>
        <Causes Image="0">
          <Title>Causes</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Peripheral artery disease is often caused by atherosclerosis. In atherosclerosis, fatty deposits (plaques) build up in your artery walls and reduce blood flow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although the heart is usually the focus of discussion of atherosclerosis, this disease can and usually does affect arteries throughout your body. When it occurs in the arteries supplying blood to your limbs, it causes peripheral artery disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Less commonly, the cause of peripheral artery disease may be blood vessel inflammation, injury to your limbs, unusual anatomy of your ligaments or muscles, or radiation exposure. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
While many people with peripheral artery disease have mild or no symptoms, some people have leg pain when walking (intermittent claudication). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Intermittent claudication symptoms include muscle pain or cramping in your legs or arms that's triggered by activity, such as walking, but disappears after a few minutes of rest. The location of the pain depends on the location of the clogged or narrowed artery. Calf pain is the most common location. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The severity of intermittent claudication varies widely, from mild discomfort to debilitating pain. Severe intermittent claudication can make it hard for you to walk or do other types of physical activity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Peripheral artery disease symptoms include:&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Painful cramping in your hip, thigh or calf muscles after activity, such as walking or climbing stairs (intermittent claudication)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Leg numbness or weakness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Coldness in your lower leg or foot, especially when compared with the other side&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sores on your toes, feet or legs that won't heal&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A change in the color of your legs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hair loss or slower hair growth on your feet and legs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slower growth of your toenails&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shiny skin on your legs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No pulse or a weak pulse in your legs or feet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Erectile dysfunction in men&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If peripheral artery disease progresses, pain may even occur when you're at rest or when you're lying down (ischemic rest pain). It may be intense enough to disrupt sleep. Hanging your legs over the edge of your bed or walking around your room may temporarily relieve the pain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have leg pain, numbness or other symptoms, don't dismiss them as a normal part of aging. Call your doctor and make an appointment. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even if you don't have symptoms of peripheral artery disease, you may need to be screened if you are: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Over age 70&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Over age 50 and have a history of diabetes or smoking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Under age 50, but have diabetes and other peripheral artery disease risk factors, such as obesity or high blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>

          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Factors that increase your risk of developing peripheral artery disease include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Smoking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Obesity (a body mass index over 30)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure (140/90 millimeters of mercury or higher)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High cholesterol (total blood cholesterol over 240 milligrams per deciliter, or 6.2 millimoles per liter)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increasing age, especially after reaching 50 years of age&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A family history of peripheral artery disease, heart disease or stroke&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High levels of homocysteine, a protein component that helps build and maintain tissue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People who smoke or have diabetes have the greatest risk of developing peripheral artery disease due to reduced blood flow. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Risk>
        <Complications Image="0">
          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
If your peripheral artery disease is caused by a buildup of plaques in your blood vessels (atherosclerosis), you're also at risk of developing: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical limb ischemia.&lt;/strong&gt; This condition begins as open sores that don't heal, an injury, or an infection of your feet or legs. Critical limb ischemia occurs when such injuries or infections progress and can cause tissue death (gangrene), sometimes requiring amputation of the affected limb.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stroke and heart attack.&lt;/strong&gt; The atherosclerosis that causes the signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease isn't limited to your legs. Fat deposits also build up in arteries supplying your heart and brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Complications>
        <Lifestyle Image="0">
          <Title>Lifestyle and home remedies</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Many people can manage the symptoms of peripheral artery disease and stop the progression of the disease through lifestyle changes, especially quitting smoking. To stabilize or improve PAD: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop smoking.&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking contributes to constriction and damage of your arteries and is a significant risk factor for the development and worsening of PAD. If you smoke, quitting is the most important thing you can do to reduce your risk of complications. If you're having trouble quitting on your own, ask your doctor about smoking cessation options, including medications to help you quit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a key component. Success in treatment of PAD is often measured by how far you can walk without pain. Proper exercise helps condition your muscles to use oxygen more efficiently. Your doctor can help you develop an appropriate exercise plan. He or she may refer you to a claudication exercise rehabilitation program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a healthy diet.&lt;/strong&gt; A heart-healthy diet low in saturated fat can help control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which contribute to atherosclerosis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid certain cold medications.&lt;/strong&gt; Over-the-counter cold remedies that contain pseudoephedrine (Advil Cold &amp; Sinus, Aleve Sinus &amp; Headache, Claritin-D, Sudafed, Tylenol Cold, Zyrtec-D, others) constrict your blood vessels and may increase your PAD symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Careful foot care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the above suggestions, take good care of your feet. People with peripheral artery disease, especially those who also have diabetes, are at risk of poor healing of sores on the lower legs and feet. Poor blood circulation can postpone or prevent proper healing and increases the risk of infection. Follow this advice to care for your feet: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wash your feet daily, dry them thoroughly and moisturize often to prevent cracks that can lead to infection. Don't moisturize between the toes, however, as this can encourage fungal growth.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wear well-fitting shoes and thick, dry socks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Promptly treat any fungal infections of the feet, such as athlete's foot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Take care when trimming your nails.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoid walking barefoot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have a foot doctor (podiatrist) treat bunions, corns or calluses.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;See your doctor at the first sign of a sore or injury to your skin.&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>Stroke</Title>
        <Text>Stroke refers to the rapid loss of brain function due to a disruption in blood supply. This can be caused by ischemia as a result of a blockage due to atherosclerosis, or by a haemorrhage. The risk factors for stroke include old age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking and atrial fibrillation. High blood pressure is the most important risk factor that can be controlled in order to prevent a stroke. Other factors such as diet, smoking and cardiovascular health also have importance.</Text>

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and food. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A stroke is a medical emergency. Prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can minimize brain damage and potential complications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The good news is that strokes can be treated and prevented, and many fewer Americans die of stroke now than even 15 years ago. Better control of major stroke risk factors &amp;mdash; high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol &amp;mdash; may be responsible for the decline.
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Caption>Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) blocks or plugs an artery leading to the brain. A blood clot often forms in arteries damaged by buildup of plaque (atherosclerosis). It can occur in the carotid artery of the neck as well as other arteries.</Caption>

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
A stroke occurs when the blood supply to your brain is interrupted or reduced. This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die. A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or a leaking or burst blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may experience a temporary disruption of blood flow through their brain (transient ischemic attack). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ischemic stroke&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;About 85 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). The most common ischemic strokes include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thrombotic stroke.&lt;/strong&gt; A thrombotic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to your brain. A clot often may be caused by fatty deposits (plaque) that build up in arteries and cause reduced blood flow (atherosclerosis) or other artery conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embolic stroke.&lt;/strong&gt; An embolic stroke occurs when a blood clot or other debris forms away from your brain &amp;mdash; commonly in your heart &amp;mdash; and is swept through your bloodstream to lodge in narrower brain arteries. This type of blood clot is called an embolus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hemorrhagic stroke&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures. Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect your blood vessels, including uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) and weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms). A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) &amp;mdash; an abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels, present at birth. The types of hemorrhagic stroke include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;/strong&gt; In an intracerebral hemorrhage, a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain tissue, damaging brain cells. Brain cells beyond the leak are deprived of blood and damaged. High blood pressure, trauma, vascular malformations, use of blood-thinning medications and other conditions may cause intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage.&lt;/strong&gt; In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, an artery on or near the surface of your brain bursts and spills into the space between the surface of your brain and your skull. This bleeding is often signaled by a sudden, severe headache. A subarachnoid hemorrhage is commonly caused by the rupture of an aneurysm, a small sack-shaped or berry-shaped outpouching on an artery in the brain. After the hemorrhage, the blood vessels in your brain may widen and narrow erratically (vasospasm), causing brain cell damage by further limiting blood flow to parts of your brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Transient ischemic attack (TIA)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;A transient ischemic attack (TIA) &amp;mdash; also called a ministroke &amp;mdash; is a brief episode of symptoms similar to those you'd have in a stroke. A transient ischemic attack is caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain. TIAs often last less than five minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris blocks blood flow to part of your brain. A TIA doesn't leave lasting symptoms because the blockage is temporary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seek emergency care even if your symptoms seem to clear up. If you've had a TIA, it means there's likely a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain, putting you at a greater risk of a full-blown stroke that could cause permanent damage later. It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or a TIA based only on your symptoms. Up to half of people whose symptoms appear to go away actually have had a stroke causing brain damage.
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Watch for these signs and symptoms if you think you or someone else may be having a stroke. Note when your signs and symptoms begin, because the length of time they have been present may guide your treatment decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trouble with walking.&lt;/strong&gt; You may stumble or experience sudden dizziness, loss of balance or loss of coordination.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trouble with speaking and understanding.&lt;/strong&gt; You may experience confusion. You may slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg.&lt;/strong&gt; You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg, especially on one side of your body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Similarly, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trouble with seeing in one or both eyes.&lt;/strong&gt; You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headache.&lt;/strong&gt; A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate you're having a stroke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek immediate medical attention&lt;/strong&gt; if you notice any signs or symptoms of a stroke, even if they seem to fluctuate or disappear. Call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Every minute counts. Don't wait to see if symptoms go away. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability. To maximize the effectiveness of evaluation and treatment, you'll need to be treated at a hospital within three hours after your first symptoms appeared. If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance.
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

        <Risk Image="0">
          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Many factors can increase your risk of a stroke. A number of these factors can also increase your chances of having a heart attack. Stroke risk factors include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Potentially treatable risk factors&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure &amp;mdash; risk of stroke begins to increase at blood pressure readings higher than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Your doctor will help you decide on a target blood pressure based on your age, whether you have diabetes and other factors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cigarette smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High cholesterol &amp;mdash; a total cholesterol level above 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 5.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Being overweight or obese.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Physical inactivity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (a sleep disorder in which the oxygen level intermittently drops during the night).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, heart defects, heart infection or abnormal heart rhythm.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use of some birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heavy or binge drinking.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use of illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Other risk factors&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Personal or family history of stroke, heart attack or TIA.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Being age 55 or older.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Race &amp;mdash; African-Americans have higher risk of stroke than people of other races.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gender &amp;mdash; Men have a higher risk of stroke than women. Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they are more likely to die of strokes than men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Risk>
        <Complications Image="0">
          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
A stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities, depending on how long the brain suffers a lack of blood flow and which part was affected. Complications may include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paralysis or loss of muscle movement.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes a lack of blood flow to the brain can cause you to become paralyzed on one side of your body, or lose control of certain muscles, such as those on one side of your face or one arm. This can cause difficulty with several daily activities, including walking, eating and dressing. With physical therapy, you may see improvement in muscle movement or paralysis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty talking or swallowing.&lt;/strong&gt; A stroke may cause you to have less control over the way the muscles in your mouth and throat move, making it difficult for you to talk, swallow or eat. For example, some people may experience slurred speech (dysarthria), due to incoordination of muscles in your mouth. You also may have difficulty with language (aphasia), including speaking or understanding speech, reading or writing. Therapy with a speech and language pathologist may help you improve your skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory loss or thinking difficulties.&lt;/strong&gt; Many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss. Others may have difficulty thinking, making judgments, reasoning and understanding concepts. These complications may improve with rehabilitation therapies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional problems.&lt;/strong&gt; People who have had strokes may have more difficulty controlling their emotions, or they may develop depression.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain.&lt;/strong&gt; Some people who have had strokes may have pain, numbness or other strange sensations in parts of their bodies affected by stroke. For example, if a stroke causes you to lose feeling in your left arm, you may develop an uncomfortable tingling sensation in that arm. Some people may be sensitive to temperature changes, especially extreme cold. This is called central stroke pain or central pain syndrome (CPS). This complication generally develops several weeks after a stroke, and it may improve over time. But because the pain is caused by a problem in your brain, instead of a physical injury, few medications may treat CPS.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in behavior and self-care.&lt;/strong&gt; People who have had strokes may become more withdrawn and less social or more impulsive. They may lose the ability to care for themselves and may need a caretaker to help them with their grooming needs and daily chores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As with any brain injury, the success of treating these complications will vary from person to person.

        <Title>Sudden Cardiac Arrest</Title>
        <Text>Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating, which results in the interruption of normal blood flow. This may be due to a heart attack, which in turn may be the consequence of coronary heart disease. Other cardiac abnormalities can also be responsible for sudden cardiac death, especially in young adults. The risk factors for sudden cardiac arrest are similar to those for coronary heart disease. Besides genetic factors, common risk factors include smoking, lack of physical exercise, obesity and diabetes.</Text>

          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. Sudden cardiac arrest usually results from an electrical disturbance in your heart that disrupts its pumping action, stopping blood flow to the rest of your body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sudden cardiac arrest is different from a heart attack, which occurs when blood flow to a portion of the heart is blocked. However, a heart attack can sometimes trigger an electrical disturbance that leads to sudden cardiac arrest. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If not treated immediately, it causes sudden cardiac death. With fast, appropriate medical care, survival is possible. Administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) &amp;mdash; or even just compressions to the chest &amp;mdash; can improve the chances of survival until emergency personnel arrive. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Caption>A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.</Caption>
          </Image>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
The immediate cause of sudden cardiac arrest is usually an abnormality in your heart rhythm (arrhythmia), the result of a problem with your heart's electrical system. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unlike other muscles in your body, which rely on nerve connections to receive the electrical stimulation they need to function, your heart has its own electrical stimulator &amp;mdash; a specialized group of cells called the sinus node located in the upper right chamber (right atrium) of your heart. The sinus node generates electrical impulses that flow in an orderly manner through your heart to synchronize the heart rate and coordinate the pumping of blood from your heart to the rest of your body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If something goes wrong with the sinus node or the flow of electric impulses through your heart, an arrhythmia can result, causing your heart to beat too fast, too slow or in an irregular fashion. Often these interruptions in rhythm are momentary and harmless. But some types of arrhythmia can be serious and lead to a sudden stop in heart function (sudden cardiac arrest). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The most common cause of cardiac arrest is an arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation &amp;mdash; when rapid, erratic electrical impulses cause your ventricles to quiver uselessly instead of pumping blood. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most of the time, cardiac-arrest-inducing arrhythmias don't occur on their own. In a person with a normal, healthy heart, a lasting irregular heart rhythm isn't likely to develop without an outside trigger, such as an electrical shock, the use of illegal drugs or trauma to the chest at just the wrong time of the heart's cycle (commotio cordis). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Heart conditions that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A life-threatening arrhythmia usually develops in a person with a pre-existing heart condition, such as: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronary artery disease.&lt;/strong&gt; Most cases of sudden cardiac arrest occur in people who have coronary artery disease. In coronary artery disease, your arteries become clogged with cholesterol and other deposits, reducing blood flow to your heart. This can make it harder for your heart to conduct electrical impulses smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart attack.&lt;/strong&gt; If a heart attack occurs, often as a result of severe coronary artery disease, it can trigger ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest. In addition, a heart attack can leave behind areas of scar tissue. Electrical short circuits around the scar tissue can lead to abnormalities in your heart rhythm.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy).&lt;/strong&gt; This occurs primarily when your heart's muscular walls stretch and enlarge or thicken. In both cases, your heart's muscle is abnormal, a condition that often leads to heart tissue damage and potential arrhythmias.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valvular heart disease.&lt;/strong&gt; Leaking or narrowing of your heart valves can lead to stretching or thickening of your heart muscle or both. When the chambers become enlarged or weakened because of stress caused by a tight or leaking valve, there's an increased risk of developing arrhythmia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congenital heart disease.&lt;/strong&gt; When sudden cardiac arrest occurs in children or adolescents, it may be due to a heart condition that was present at birth (congenital heart disease). Even adults who've had corrective surgery for a congenital heart defect still have a higher risk of sudden cardiac arrest.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical problems in the heart.&lt;/strong&gt; In some people, the problem is in the heart's electrical system itself instead of a problem with the heart muscle or valves. These are called primary heart rhythm abnormalities and include conditions such as Brugada's syndrome and long QT syndrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Causes>
        <Symptoms Image="0">
          <Title>Symptoms</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Sudden cardiac arrest symptoms are immediate and drastic. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sudden collapse&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No pulse&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No breathing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Loss of consciousness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes other signs and symptoms precede sudden cardiac arrest. These may include fatigue, fainting, blackouts, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, palpitations or vomiting. But sudden cardiac arrest often occurs with no warning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have frequent episodes of chest pain or discomfort, heart palpitations, irregular or rapid heartbeats, unexplained wheezing or shortness of breath, or fainting or near fainting or you're feeling lightheaded or dizzy, see your doctor promptly. If these symptoms are ongoing, you should call 911 or emergency medical help. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When the heart stops, the lack of oxygenated blood can cause brain damage in only a few minutes. Death or permanent brain damage can occur within four to six minutes. Time is critical when you're helping an unconscious person who isn't breathing. Take immediate action. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call 911,&lt;/strong&gt; or the emergency number in your area, if you encounter someone who has collapsed or is found unresponsive. If the unconscious person is a child and you're alone, administer CPR, or chest compressions only, for two minutes before calling 911 or emergency medical help or before using a portable defibrillator.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perform CPR.&lt;/strong&gt; Quickly check the unconscious person's breathing. If he or she isn't breathing normally, begin CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest &amp;mdash; about 100 compressions a minute. If you've been trained in CPR, check the person's airway and deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions. If you haven't been trained, just continue chest compressions. Allow the chest to rise completely between compressions. Keep doing this until a portable defibrillator is available or emergency personnel arrive.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a portable defibrillator,&lt;/strong&gt; if one is available. If you're not trained to use a portable defibrillator, a 911 or emergency medical help operator may be able to guide you in its use. Deliver one shock if advised by the device and then immediately begin CPR starting with chest compressions, or give chest compressions only, for about two minutes. Using the defibrillator, check the person's heart rhythm. If necessary, the defibrillator will administer a shock. Repeat this cycle until the person recovers consciousness or emergency personnel take over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Portable automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are available in an increasing number of places, including airports, casinos and shopping malls. You can also purchase them for your home. AEDs come with built-in instructions for their use. They're programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate. 
&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

          <Title>Risk factors</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
Because sudden cardiac arrest is so often linked with coronary artery disease, the same factors that put you at risk of coronary artery disease may also put you at risk of sudden cardiac arrest. These include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A family history of coronary artery disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Smoking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High blood cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Obesity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A sedentary lifestyle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Drinking too much alcohol (more than one to two drinks a day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other factors that may increase your risk of sudden cardiac arrest include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A previous episode of cardiac arrest or a family history of cardiac arrest&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A previous heart attack&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A personal or family history of other forms of heart disease, such as heart rhythm disorders, congenital heart defects, heart failure and cardiomyopathy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Age &amp;mdash; the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest increases with age, especially after age 45 for men and age 55 for women&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Being male &amp;mdash; men are two to three times more likely to experience sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Using illegal drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nutritional imbalance, such as low potassium or magnesium levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
        </Risk>
        <Complications Image="0">
          <Title>Complications</Title>
          <Text>&lt;p&gt;
When sudden cardiac arrest occurs, your brain is the first part of your body to suffer because, unlike other organs, it doesn't have a reserve of oxygen-rich blood. It's completely dependent on an uninterrupted supply of blood. Reduced blood flow to your brain causes unconsciousness. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If your heart rhythm doesn't rapidly return to its normal rhythm, brain damage occurs and death results. If sudden cardiac arrest lasts more than 10 minutes, survival is rare. Survivors of cardiac arrest may show signs of brain damage.

        <Title>Aspirin</Title>
        <Text>Aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid) is the most commonly used antiplatelet drug, and is prescribed for both primary and secondary care of cardiovascular diseases. When patients at high risk for a cardiovascular disease are treated with aspirin, they have a greatly reduced chance (&amp;gt;30\%) of non-fatal myocardial infarction, experience a 25\% reduction in non-fatal stroke and benefit from a significant decrease in mortality. Aspirin works by binding irreversibly to the COX1 enzyme which is involved in the platelet aggregation process. The effect of the drug is not the same on all patients. Some patients who are prescribed aspirin suffer from specific thromboembolic vascular conditions. These adverse reactions are broadly referred to as 'aspirin resistance'.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for reduced drug in an individual indicates that a standard dose of the drug does not have an optimal pharmacological effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for increased drug efficacy in an individual indicates that a standard dose of the drug has a greater pharmacological effect on the individual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The absence of a genetic marker indicates normal efficacy with a standard dose is expected.&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>Beta-blocker (Bucindolol)</Title>
        <Text>Beta-blockers are drugs used in the management of heart disease. It is the excessive activation of the adrenergic nervous system that in many cases contributes to the symptoms of cardiovascular disease. The beta-blocker drugs are competitive antagonists of the adrenergic receptors. They modulate the activity of the pathway and assist in the management of cardiovascular diseases. They are routinely prescribed as a first-line agent for the treatment of heart failure, hypertension and angina. They also provide protection following a heart attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genetic differences contribute to differences in response to beta-blocker therapy. You have variations in your CYP2D6 enzyme that alter the speed at which Bucindolol is broken down. This carries a risk of differences in your antihypertensive response to Bucindolol. If you are prescribed Bucindolol or other beta-blockers for the management of blood pressure and or heart disease, we would recommend that you discuss this with your physician.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for reduced drug efficacy means that a standard dose of the drug does not have an optimal pharmacological effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for increased drug efficacy means that a standard dose of the drug has a greater pharmacological effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The absence of a pharmacogenetic marker means normal efficacy with a standard dose is expected.&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>Beta-blocker (Metoprolol)</Title>
        <Text>Beta-blockers are drugs used in the management of heart disease. It is the excessive activation of the adrenergic nervous system that in many cases contributes to the symptoms of cardiovascular disease. Beta-blocker drugs are competitive antagonists of the adrenergic receptors. They modulate the activity of the pathway and assist in the management of cardiovascular diseases. They are routinely prescribed as a first-line agent for the treatment of heart failure, hypertension and angina. They also provide protection following a heart attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genetic differences contribute to differences in response to beta-blocker therapy. You have variations in your CYP2D6 enzyme that alter the speed at which Metoprolol is broken down. This carries a risk of differences in your antihypertensive response to Metoprolol. If you have been prescribed Metoprolol or other beta-blockers for the management of blood pressure and or heart disease, we would recommend that you discuss this with your physician.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for reduced drug efficacy means that a standard dose of the drug does not have an optimal pharmacological effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for increased drug efficacy means that a standard dose of the drug has a greater pharmacological effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The absence of a pharmacogenetic marker means normal efficacy with a standard dose is expected.&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>PLAVIX (Clopidogrel)</Title>
        <Text>Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug that inhibits clots in coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease. It is prescribed to patients who have been diagnosed with symptomatic atherosclerosis. It may also be prescribed with aspirin to prevent thrombosis following intracoronary stent surgery. Clopidogrel is a pro-drug in that it needs to be metabolised by the CYP2C19 enzyme before it becomes functional. Approximately 14\% of the population have genetic variations for this enzyme that make it slower for the patient's body to metabolise clopidogrel. The patients may not respond to treatment and are therefore at increased risk for serious adverse events that include death through heart attack and stroke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for reduced drug efficacy means that a standard dose of the drug does not have an optimal pharmacological effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for increased drug efficacy means that a standard dose of the drug has a greater pharmacological effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The absence of a pharmacogenetic marker means normal efficacy with a standard dose is expected.&lt;/li&gt;

        <Title>Statins</Title>
        <Text>Statins are drugs used to lower blood cholesterol (LDL) levels by inhibiting the liver enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Statins are routinely prescribed to patients with cardiovascular diseases. They are not usually prescribed to individuals who have increased blood cholesterol but who have not been diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases. There are severe adverse drug reactions associated with statins, including myopathy and increased production of liver enzymes. We have tested for genetic variants that affect your sensitivity to the drug and may be used to personalise your dosage if you need to take the drug. The results of many clinical trials have shown that statin therapy is usually safe and the incidence of adverse drug reactions is low. There are however some differences in the speed and dosage that are optimum for individuals. Your genome has been tested for common variants that correspond to differences in your ability to metabolise the statin drug.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for reduced drug efficacy means that a standard dose of the drug does not have an optimal pharmacological effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for increased drug efficacy means that a standard dose of the drug has a greater pharmacological effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A genetic marker for myopathy corresponds to a risk for an adverse drug reaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The absence of a pharmacogenetic marker means you would expect normal efficacy with standard dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>

      <Description>
        <Title>Warfarin</Title>
        <Text>Warfarin is a drug used as an anticoagulant to prevent thrombosis and thromboembolism. Warfarin activity is determined by genetic factors that can be used to assist a doctor to prescribe an optimal dosage of the drug for a patient. The process of determining an effective and safe dosage for therapeutic anticoagulation is complicated by the patterns of genetic variation that alter the body's ability to metabolise the drug. Dtect Cardio screens for genetic differences in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 enzymes. The results can be used to ensure appropriate drug dosage and prevent serious adverse drug reactions such as haemorrhage and necrosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have genetic variations that are likely to confer a difference in your body's ability to metabolise warfarin. If you have been prescribed warfarin for the management of your heart disease, it is important that you discuss these genetic variants with your doctor. Clinics are already aware of the intricacies and can use this information to better calculate the optimal starting dose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The genetic markers for warfarin correspond to known pharmacogenetic dosage markers and can be used by your doctor to optimise your warfarin therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The absence of a pharmacogenetic marker means normal efficacy with a standard dose is expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</Text>
